str_town_alt_prosperity_0|The few items sold in the market appear to be priced well out of the range of the inhabitants. The people are malnourished, their animals are sick or dying, and the tools of their trade appear to be broken. The back alleys have been abandoned to flies and mangy dogs.
str_town_alt_prosperity_20|You hear grumbling in the marketplace about the price of everyday items, and the shops are half empty.

str_town_alt_prosperity_60|The people look well-fed and relatively content. Craftsmen do a thriving business, and some migrants appear to be coming here from other regions to seek their luck.
str_town_alt_prosperity_80|The walls, streets, and homes are well-maintained. The markets are thronged with migrants from the nearby regions drawn here by the availability of both goods and work. The rhythm of hammers and looms speak to the business of the artisans' workshops.
str_village_alt_prosperity_0|Only a handful of people are strong enough to work in the fields, many of which are becoming overgrown with weeds. The rest are weak and malnourished, or have already fled elsewhere. The draft animals have long since starved or were eaten, although a few carcasses still lie on the outskirts, their bones gnawed by wild beasts.
str_village_alt_prosperity_20|Some farmers and animals are out in the fields, but their small numbers suggest that some villagers may be emigrating in search of food. Farm implements look rusty and broken. Brush and weeds seem to be reclaiming some of the outermost fields.
str_village_alt_prosperity_40|The fields and orchards are busy, with villagers engaged in the tasks of the seasons. Humans and animals alike look relatively healthy and well-fed.

Seasonal laborers appear to be flocking here to help with the work and join in the general prosperity.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_0|The palm groves are virtually abandoned, and the canals which irrigate them are clogged with silt. The handful of villagers you see look malnourished and restless. The draft animals have long since starved or were eaten, although a few carcasses still lie on the outskirts, their bones gnawed by the wild jackals of the desert.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_20|Few villagers can be seen tending to the palm groves, and in places, the desert dunes appear to be encroaching on the gardens. Many of the canals are clogged with silt, and the wells and cisterns are filled with sand.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_40|Men and women are busy tending the palm groves, climbing to the tops of trees to pollinate the fruit. Healthy animals draw the pumps and wheels that bring water to the fields. Some of the irrigation canals and cisterns, however, could use some maintenance.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_60|The palm groves and orchards are humming with activity. Farmers call to each other cheerfully from the tops of the trees, where they pollinate the date fruit. The creak of wooden pumps, the bellowing of draft animals, and the rush of flowing water speak of an irrigation system that is thriving under the villagers' attention.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_80|The palm groves are humming with activity, as farmers load up a bumper crop of dates for sale to the market. Men and women are hard at work digging new wells and canals, to bring additional land under irrigation.

str_banner_selection_text|You have been awarded the right to carry a banner. Your banner will signify your status as a Noble of Pendor and bring you honor. Which banner do you want to choose?
str_retirement_text_1|You grew weary of fighting Pendor's battles, and your old wounds trouble you these days. You spent too much money on troops and gear in your youth, but long since sold off your armor and weapons and are now virtually penniless. Thanks to the charity of the friendly lord of {s9} you get by, cleaning his stables and sweeping his courtyard. Your glory days are over and you no longer speak of them, though you still have your memories; little enough recompense for all those years of fighting for a lost cause. You keep those to yourself, because no one is interested in the ramblings of a half-crippled stableman who might once have been a soldier.
str_retirement_text_2|You always lived for today and rarely considered tomorrow, assuming you would be killed in battle long before you were too old to fight. When your money ran out you joined the Red Brotherhood as a low-level outlaw and now run errands for those you once sold to the galleys. Sometimes you reflect bitterly on the irony of your current life. Your once-high ideals are gone, as you realize you are now robbing those whom you used to defend. You slip deeper into a life of crime and cruelty. Your life ends on the gallows for murder and you laugh as the {s9} hangman tightens the noose around your neck.
str_retirement_text_3|You have come down considerably from your days as a {s13}, though you still retain the mannerisms of your former days. Your troops have deserted or died in your battles. You take to drink and drift from tavern to tavern, boring all those willing to listen with tales of your former successes, while hustling drinks from the patrons. Once in a while someone recognizes you, but your former fame is good only for a free drink from a kind man who remembers what you once were.
str_retirement_text_4|You finally realize you are tired of war, and retire to the village of {s7}, which you once freed from bandits. The grateful villagers accept you as one of their own, and you make your living training the village militia and do a bit of farming. You marry a village {reg63?lass:lad} and raise a flock of sturdy peasant children who never tire of your tales of the battles you fought and the enemies you vanquished. You shout angrily at your oldest son, who wants to become a soldier. You end your days a respected village Elder, content with the peace and family you found in {s7}.
str_retirement_text_5|What once seemed a vast sum of denars evaporates quickly, but you have enough left of your loot to purchase a tavern in {s9}. You smile to recall that you have purchased this same inn twice, as you once paid a handsome sum to the former innkeeper for damages your men did to this very tavern. The men of the {s9} garrison patronize your tavern and enjoy hearing your tales of victorious battles against overwhelming odds though they take them with a grain of salt. Your profits grow, and you expand your premises to include a banquet and wedding hall. Your inn is famous all over Pendor, and you are now a more successful host than you ever were a {s13}.
str_retirement_text_6|As you fought over the length and breadth of Pendor, as a {s13} you traded between towns and villages, and found you had a good head for business. You have battled many foes,{s15} and invested your profits with a trader in {s9}, whose caravans you once escorted. You now own several warehouses in {s9}, your caravans traverse Pendor and your ships carry heavy cargoes to and from Barclay. You marry the trader's {reg63?daughter:son} and train up your children as good little merchants. Sometimes over wine, you regale your clients and partner with tales of your days as a soldier, but memories fade. The success of your merchanting dynasty will long outlast your fame as a {s13}.
str_retirement_text_7|Though you came to Pendor a penniless adventurer, your battle successes have made you rich. You own the town of {s9} and prove to be a capable administrator, skilled at delegating while keeping a wary eye on your underlings. Your holdings prosper and pay a fine income because you keep taxes low to encourage investment. Your improvements have paid off and you are a popular {reg63?lord:lady} in Pendor. When you must ride to battle, you feel young again as the clash of weapons stirs your blood. Still, you really prefer hunting to battle and adjudicating trade disputes to fighting wars. You are overall quite content with your lot and don't regret your retirement.
str_retirement_text_8|Though once hailed as the savior prophesied by Madigan, you failed to unite all Pendor under your banner. You are revered as a great Pendorian hero because you fought off many invading armies,{s15} whose wars once tore Pendor apart. Peace pervades Pendor, and you deal with those who disturb it harshly. You are careful to stay on good terms with your vassals and your neighbor kings and are ever vigilant against future threats to Pendor. Not having a taste for administration, you kept {s8} and awarded the rest to your faithful companions and vassals. Sometimes you all get together and speak of the old days, reminiscing about your glorious deeds, but all of you agree that peace is preferable to the constant warfare of your early years in Pendor.
str_retirement_text_9|Though once hailed as the savior prophesied by Madigan, you failed to unite all Pendor under one banner. You fought and defeated huge invading armies,{s15} but did not become the {reg63?king:queen} of all Pendor. Your holdings are vast and you are wealthy beyond your wildest dreams. Lords who once sneered at you now curry your favor because you outrank them and still have the reputation of dealing effectively and fatally with insults. You rule your own holdings with a firm and just hand and rarely think any more of your hand-to-mouth days as a soldier.
str_retirement_text_10|All Pendor lies beneath your hand and you are everywhere hailed as the savior Madigan prophesied would unite the land. You defeated all invading armies, beat back avaricious and power-hungry Lords, and humbled Pendor's so-called Kings. Your slightest wish is a command and your word is absolute law throughout the land. Luckily, you are both fair and just, and never abuse your position. You always remember your humble beginnings, though now every luxury available is yours for the asking. You reward loyalty and swiftly punish wrongdoing and the people love you for it. Still, you know how quickly a throne can be lost, and never relax your vigilance. Sometimes you stand atop your castle and look to the South, wondering what will come next to Pendor.

str_npc_adonja_intro|Yes? You wish to speak with me? I'm in no mood for idle chitchat, so be brief.
str_npc_leslie_intro|Hello, {reg63?Sir:Madam}. Are you in need of a quartermaster skilled in all aspects of distribution and procurement of supplies?
str_npc_ansen_intro|Good day, my {reg63?Lord:Lady}.
str_npc_riva_intro|Greetings, {reg63?Sir:Madam}. I am Riva Blackwolf of Laria. Doubtless you have heard my name?
str_npc_kassim_intro|Greetings, {reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}. Would you share tea and conversation with one alone and far from his home?
str_npc_lethaldiran_intro|Greetings, human. Would you happen to be in need of a Noldor's services?
str_npc_jocelyn_intro|Why do you stare at me, {reg63?Sir:Madam}? Have you never laid eyes upon a knight before? Do you think this is a zoo?
str_npc_alistair_intro|I needed a drink to steady my nerves! I came upon a dead girl outside of town. Her heart had been ripped from her breast.
str_npc_rayne_intro|Well met, my good {reg63?Sir:Lady}. Would you like to share a drink with me.
str_npc_julia_intro|Greetings there, {reg63?Lord:Lady} Captain, I am Julia, formerly of Janos.
str_npc_frederick_intro|Hail, Mijn Commandant. What word have you of the wars in Pendor?
str_npc_ediz_intro|I salute you, {reg63?lord:lady} Captain.
str_npc_sara_intro|Greetings, Captain. I am called Sara the Fox.
str_npc_donavan_intro|Yes? What is it you wish, stranger? I've little patience with tavern gossipers.
str_npc_diev_intro|If I wanted company, I'd have it already. That said, the company wouldn't look at all like you.
str_npc_alyssa_intro|Greetingssss. Do you sseek sskilled ssoldierss for your company?
str_npc_roland_intro|Good day to you, {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain. I am pleased to make your acquaintance under these circumstances.
str_npc_kaverra_intro|What do you want?
str_npc_sigismund_intro|What the hell do you want with me, stranger? Piss off, and leave a man to drown his sorrows in peace.
str_npc_boadice_intro|Well, well, a proper-looking warrior at last. I'd quite despaired of finding one. I've been looking for a Captain worth joining, but I will not follow just anyone!
str_npc_adonja_intro_response_1|Yes, I do. You have the look of a fighter who might be looking for work.
str_npc_leslie_intro_response_1|Perhaps. Are you a military quartermaster or a trader looking to change jobs?
str_npc_ansen_intro_response_1|Hello. You look a trifle elevated in station to be hanging about in here.
str_npc_riva_intro_response_1|Never heard of you. What did you say your name was?
str_npc_kassim_intro_response_1|Thanks. With whom do I have the pleasure of taking tea? What has brought you here?
str_npc_lethaldiran_intro_response_1|I could be. What's your story?
str_npc_jocelyn_intro_response_1|I am curious why a knight of your obvious standing is seeking work in a tavern, Sir.
str_npc_alistair_intro_response_1|The Heretics must have been at work again! Bastards!
str_npc_rayne_intro_response_1|My thanks, I'd be delighted. What is the origin of that falcon emblem on your shield?
str_npc_julia_intro_response_1|Well met, Julia. What made you move away from Janos?
str_npc_frederick_intro_response_1|They are endemic, sir. War would appear to be Pendor's national sport.
str_npc_ediz_intro_response_1|You are far from Singalian lands. What brings you to Pendor?
str_npc_sara_intro_response_1|Hello there, Sara. How did you get your foxy nickname?
str_npc_donavan_intro_response_1|I always speak to travelers in taverns - I like to hear the news.
str_npc_diev_intro_response_1|Why are you so rude and antisocial?
str_npc_alyssa_intro_response_1_|You speak like a damned snake priestess - I trust you are not one?
str_npc_roland_intro_response_1|I am honored to make yours, Sir Knight. May I know your name?
str_npc_kaverra_intro_response_1|I'm curious about that interesting weapon of yours. I've never seen anything like it.
str_npc_sigismund_intro_response_1|Drinking alone is no fun. Why are you drunk at this time of day, instead of with your troop?
str_npc_boadice_intro_response_1|Hello, good lady. Where do you hail from?
str_npc_adonja_intro_response_2|You mistake, madam; I don't wish to speak with you at all.
str_npc_leslie_intro_response_2|No, sorry, I don't need a merchant in my company
str_npc_ansen_intro_response_2|I'm sorry, I need fighters, not bookish dilettantes.
str_npc_riva_intro_response_2|No thanks, I dislike wolves and you look like a bandit to me.
str_npc_kassim_intro_response_2|I regret that I cannot linger just now.
str_npc_lethaldiran_intro_response_2|Bugger off, Noldor lad, I'm busy.
str_npc_jocelyn_intro_response_2|I always stare at knights with churlish manners. Good day.
str_npc_alistair_intro_response_2|And what do you know about the girl's death? Answer me! You've a sneaky look about you.
str_npc_rayne_intro_response_2|Thank you Sir Knight, but I must decline.
str_npc_julia_intro_response_2|A pleasure to have met you, but I'm too busy to talk just now.
str_npc_frederick_intro_response_2|I know only what everyone else knows. Pendor suffers under constant warmongering.
str_npc_ediz_intro_response_2|I'd stop to chat, but I have another appointment.
str_npc_sara_intro_response_2|You've a catchy name, Sara, but I've no time to talk.
str_npc_donavan_intro_response_2|Nothing at all. My apologies.
str_npc_diev_intro_response_2|I don't offer my company to surly clods, so we're even. Good day.
str_npc_alyssa_intro_response_2|Take your hisses elsewhere; I've no liking for them or your filthy Cult.
str_npc_roland_intro_response_2|I am honored to meet you, Sir Knight, but I must rejoin my troop.
str_npc_kaverra_intro_response_2|Interesting weapon, that, but I've no time to chat just now. Goodbye.
str_npc_sigismund_intro_response_2|Not much of a conversationalist, are you? I'll leave you to your solitary drinking.
str_npc_boadice_intro_response_2|Nice to have met you and good luck finding a captain who'll sign you on.
str_npc_adonja_backstory_a|I am Adonja of the Rocktops, from the finest raiding clan in the Mystmountains, the Catsclaws.  Our Clan is greatly favored by Vejovis, or so I once thought.  My father is a great clan Chief who trained me well to fight and raid.
str_npc_leslie_backstory_a|I am primarily a trader, and my name is Leslie. A sad turn of events has stranded me here, with barely a denar to my name and no way of returning home.
str_npc_ansen_backstory_a|I have no station, and I shall tell you why! My name is Ansen, by the way, a pleasure to meet you.
str_npc_riva_backstory_a|Really? Well, perhaps your ignorance can be forgiven. You don't look like a Pendorian, so I take it you are a stranger in these lands?
str_npc_kassim_backstory_a|I am Kassim, son of Jamshid, grandson of Bahman, great-grandson of Ikram, a Pamiri D'Shar of the high passes. Were you of Pendor, you'd know why I am so far from home.
str_npc_lethaldiran_backstory_a|Allow me to present myself: I am Lethaldiran, once of the House of Ithilrandir, but now, alas, an exile. It may seem unusual to you to find a Noldor seeking work in a tavern, but I am unfortunately now adrift in the human world.
str_npc_jocelyn_backstory_a|I am Sir Jocelyn from the Order of Eventide, {reg63?Sir:Madam}. The Order of the Dawn put to the stake one of our most venerable brothers, then took to burning peasants and nobility, setting villages afire and other atrocities. I came to Pendor with the Order of Eventide. I did not realize then that they are Heretics and followers of the evil goddess Erida Occisor. If my Order locates me, I will be killed gruesomely for my defection.
str_npc_alistair_backstory_a|I simply stumbled upon the poor girl and quickly ascertained that she was beyond any help I could give. I am the younger son of a high Lord in Barclay, Ferenc the Noxious, come to Pendor like many other knights to make my name and fortune. I was dodging a party of those sanctimonious Twits of the Dawn, when I tripped over the girl. You don't happen to know if they're headed in this direction, do you? If so, I must depart immediately, and I'd advise you to do the same. They are deadly enemies to my Order, and will likely attack you as well - they take rather unreasonable dislikes very quickly.
str_npc_rayne_backstory_a|This shield? It is my birthright, my good {reg63?sir:lady}. I am Sir Rayne, the last Knight of the Falcon, sole remainder of a gallant Order outlawed ten years ago by the King of Ravenstern himself. My fellows hung up their armor, or were hunted down and slain. The one exception was my mentor, Sir Leodred.
str_npc_julia_backstory_a|It's a long story, {reg63?lord:madam} Captain, but if you'll get yourself a drink and one for me, too, while you're at it, I'll be glad to tell you the tale.
str_npc_frederick_backstory_a|I am Hauptmann Frederick von Mettenheim, and I am a Great Swordsman of the Forlorn Hope Regiment of the Isle of Mettenheim. Mettenheim was invaded by Barclay, while we were in the grip of a great famine. I accompanied the Count of Mettenheim, my General, to Pendor to secure trade agreements for food, and perhaps make an agreement for the lease of arable land. We have much to offer in trade, since our specialty is smelting and the casting of all things metal. Unfortunately, we were first shipwrecked, then those not drowned were massacred by a large band of Snake Cultists.
str_npc_ediz_backstory_a|I am Ediz, a Singalian, as you have surmised. We are a simple people and our code is equally simple: We fight to the death in battle and never retreat. We do not desert our Lords unless they prove themselves unworthy by cowardly flight from battle. This was the case with the lord whom I served. I have come to Pendor to regain through battle the honor I lost with my lord, who fled like a cur and disgraced us all.
str_npc_sara_backstory_a|If it is a tale you desire, then a tale I assuredly shall tell. I am called 'the Fox' because my words and allure enchant my would-be suitors, leaving them in hot pursuit of a fox they can never catch. With my pursuit of pleasure, my keen wits and my eloquent songs and poetry, I enrapture every man I encounter. When cornered, I fight; when chased, I go to ground. With my rapier I fence moonlight, on my steed, I race the dawn.
str_npc_donavan_backstory_a|Very well, as you wish. I would welcome the company. My name is Donavan and I come from across your Western Sea, though we call it another name in my homeland.
str_npc_diev_backstory_a|You'd not be very sociable yourself, if you'd lived my life. I am called Diev. My parents were killed by Mystmountain Raiders when I was only a babe. Members of a passing caravan heard me crying in my dead mother's arms and rescued me. The Caravan Master adopted me, as he and his wife were childless. I grew up in Rane, but I disappointed my adopted father because I had no aptitude for trade, and less taste for it.
str_npc_alyssa_backstory_a|You correctly identify my acssent; I am Alyssa, a former SSerpent Cult Priestess, but the operative word iss 'former.'  They tell me I wass taken in the Empire as a baby, but my only memories are of the Cult. I have forssaken the SSnake Cult and sshall never rejoin them. If you have fought my Cult, you know how sskilled at arms we Priestesses are. I am in deadly danger from my Cult, and musst join a sstrong commander - there is ssafety in numberss for me.
str_npc_roland_backstory_a|I am Sir Roland, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, sole Paladin of the Dawn. My Order's original mission was to eradicate injustice and lawlessness, that the Goddess Astraea might dwell upon the earth once more. My fellow Order members have forgotten their principles and I have abandoned them to escape their misguided cruelties, though I still follow the Goddess Astraea's injunctions to us.
str_npc_kaverra_backstory_a|Well, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, I call it a 'Man-Opener', and it lives up to its name, same's I live up to mine, 'Kaverra the Castrator.'  Had it made to order by the Javiksholm weapons maker.
str_npc_sigismund_backstory_a|Alright, alright, if you're buying, I'll talk while I drink. You look to be a commander yourself, so you might understand my story. My name is Sigismund and I come from Vezin, had a small farm there. Don't know why I bothered farming as long as I did. We'd raise our crops and foreign armies would burn them. We'd buy cattle and the damned Vanskerries, Mystmountains or bandits would steal them. Nobody in our village would lift a finger in defense of what was ours, except for a woman named Claire, who decided it was time to fight back.
str_npc_boadice_backstory_a|I am Boadice of the Veccavii, now unfortunately forced to abandon my isle and my sisters to seek refuge in this blighted land. My elder sister assumed the throne of Veccavi, and decided to eliminate, successfully in terms of my other sisters, any competition to her rule.
str_npc_adonja_backstory_b|When I was just thirteen, I formed my own raiding band, and had enormous successes. We had the best looting record of all the clans, even those led by men twice my age. I had the prettiest furs and a lot of gold jewelry to show for it, too. Unfortunately, Lord Stephan was waiting for us in one of the Fierdsvain villages on our last raid, and his warband killed all of my men. For the first time in my life, I ran away to save myself, after the last of my band was killed.
str_npc_leslie_backstory_b|Several months ago, my brother and I sailed from Barclay, across the Western Sea. We came to Pendor to buy Noldor artifacts, with the idea of making a profit by trading along the way. Our caravan was attacked outside Laria by a Jatu warband. My brother and our caravan guards were no match for the ferocity of the Jatu. I was the only survivor and they took me prisoner, with overtly nefarious intentions.
str_npc_ansen_backstory_b|My father, a merchant in {s20}, had me educated by our finest scholars. I spent all my time poring over books and scrolls under the tutelage of the abbot here. I didn't realize that the ultimate goal of all this education was my indoctrination into the clergy! When the abbot let that slip, I packed up what I could, left my father's house and am now in search of more manly pursuits.
str_npc_riva_backstory_b|A pity. I am of a noble family which believes in equality between men and women. As per my family's ancient traditions, I intend to make a name for myself in the profession of arms. Unfortunately, the local authorities have little understanding of the warrior's code. They have unfairly libelled me 'bandit' and 'brigand,' and put a price on my head.
str_npc_kassim_backstory_b|Since the days of my great-great grandfather, my people have had blood feud with the tribe of Yusafzai, who squat in the next valley over from ours. Many men have died in this feud, including two of my brothers. The Bahadur Khan himself ordered us to cease this blood feud, to save men for fighting the wars in Pendor. I, however, honor my duty to my tribe, and my brothers' blood cried out for vengeance. I waylaid and killed two Yusafzai on a track in the mountains. I then rode out of our village that same night, without even bidding farewell to my father. I will wait a year or two, then return home after the Khan's men have forgotten me. The Yusafzai will not forget, of course, as our blood feuds never end until all of the enemy are dead.
str_npc_lethaldiran_backstory_b|The trouble began with my hobby, which is duelling - and I became quite good at it. This, of course, meant that my duelling partners found our exercises fatal rather too often for Ithilrandir. After the demise of one of his favorite nephews, he exiled me. I have frequently found employment amongst your lords as an assassin - so many of them seem to dislike one another, don't they? Unfortunately, my latest employer failed to produce the coin promised when I completed my task, and has set his men after me to eliminate his debt.
str_npc_jocelyn_backstory_b|The Order of Eventide has dispatched one of its most experienced and ruthless knights to discover my whereabouts, and either forcibly return me to them, or kill me in the attempt. I desperately need to join a good company, both to fight the Heretics and for protection from this knight, who is close on my heels. My funds are exhausted; I have had to sell my warsteed. I suppose my armor will be next, and then I shall have to disguise myself as a peasant.
str_npc_alistair_backstory_b|As you doubtless know, the Order of the Dawn was tactfully expelled from Barclay, because of the atrocities they committed upon the populace there: burning villages, and putting peasants, merchants and even the nobility to death by fire to 'cleanse' them of what those zealots deemed their 'sins.'  They consider trivialities such as a peasant spitting as they pass by, Astraea's shrines not precisely facing the rising sun, or shrines improperly cleaned, to be capital offences. Not unnaturally, we nobles were annoyed by their wasteful destruction of our villages and peasantry. I must join a strong commander who also detests them, as they are far too strong for a single knight to tackle. I'm sure you'll agree that they are as much a blight on Pendor as ever they were on Barclay.
str_npc_rayne_backstory_b|Sir Leodred was Master-at-Arms of the Order, charged with training all new squires. I was the last admitted to the order. My father, before he died, was an Order Knight as well and I, his sole heir, was expected to fulfill his oath to the Order. My mentor, Sir Leodred, died last winter, sword in hand, defending innocents from their would-be predators. Ever since, I have been searching for a way to revive my Order, even though we are outlawed in Ravenstern.
str_npc_julia_backstory_b|I am a twin, and my brother was named Julius. My father was a sergeant in the service of a noble house in Janos. He was a strict disciplinarian, hard on his men, and harder on his family, especially Julius and me. He drilled us with sword, crossbow and spear, saying it was important that we be able to defend ourselves. After Lord Marius took the throne, my father came home less and less, explaining that his duties had increased. When he was home, he was surly and silent. Then, when Julius and I were seventeen, he began taking Julius with him on duty. Shortly thereafter, I found that the 'noble Lady' my father guarded was a Serpent Priestess. Dad and Julius were thugs who kidnapped innocent people for her purposes. When I confronted Julius about it, he tried to kill me.
str_npc_frederick_backstory_b|I am the sole surviving member of our delegation to Pendor. I cannot complete our mission here by myself and have currently no way of returning to Mettenheim. Until the Count Of Mettenheim, our ruler, learns from our lack of reports that something has happened and sends another delegation, I must live by my blade.
str_npc_ediz_backstory_b|Unlike the many Singalian mercenaries willing to hire their services to any man with a handful of gold, I require a captain worthy of my hire. I am no common mercenary and I will follow no leader who cannot live up to my standards.
str_npc_sara_backstory_b|I am a troubadour by profession, a courtesan upon occasion and a deadly enigma at all times. I am known for my elegant verse and exquisite songs. When I grow bored, I travel onward, amusing myself with whatever diversions come my way. I confess to an affection for Pendor, so for the past several years have visited its towns and castles, earning good coin with my talents.
str_npc_donavan_backstory_b|I am the second son of a Barclay noble, whom you've likely not heard of, since my land is far away. I came to seek my fortune in Pendor, training men in the art of battle. Unfortunately, the lord here in {s20} disapproves of the disciplinary methods needed to turn rabble into soldiers. I told him it was wiser to flog them now than bury them later, but he refused to listen, and advised me to take my services elsewhere.
str_npc_diev_backstory_b|I spent most of my youth in the back alleys of Rane, fighting and stealing, getting beaten for it by my father when he caught me. Once I was older, I took to hunting in the Lord's preserve, sharing the game I killed with the poor in Rane. I decided there must be more to life than poaching, so I signed on to fight with the Guard. We were ambushed one day, escorting my Lord to Poinsbruk, by a group of Renegade Knights, and all the Guard were killed but me. My Lord, who ran like a rabbit from the fray, accused me of deserting the Guard during battle, because I was the only one still alive. In truth, I was knocked unconscious and woke up surrounded by my dead mates. So, he had me drummed out of the Guard in disgrace.
str_npc_alyssa_backstory_b|I will add that I have few resservations about fighting memberss of my cult. After all, they will feel no compunctionss about killing me, now that I have left them. In termss of my accommodation within your troop, you should know that we of the Snake Cult are vegetarians and prefer organic food. I will eat no meat and I do not drink wine.
str_npc_roland_backstory_b|I was born in a village in the Empire. When I was ten, Serpent Cultists took my parents. I was studious as a boy, and with the help of our village priest, I made my way to Barclay to enter the Order of the Dawn. The Order educated me and trained me in both tactics and weapons. Now, however, my Order has outlawed me and put a price upon my head. I had to leave my Order; I could no longer tolerate the crimes they perpetrated in Astraea's name. She came to me in a dream and told me that I was her last true Knight, and that I must guide the Order back to its true purpose. I confess, I have no clue as to how to do it, particularly since they intend to burn me.
str_npc_kaverra_backstory_b|I started as 'prentice to a rope-maker, see, saved my denars, got myself a start as a peddler. I was takin' some of my old master's rope to market when I got caught by eight Vanskerry Raiders. You know what they do with women captives.
str_npc_sigismund_backstory_b|Claire was fed up with the raids and decided to do something about them. We'd known one other since childhood, and when the men laughed at her plans, she came to me. I knew she was right, and together we began raising a militia to fight those thieving bastards. A few lads from our village joined up, and then we went from place to place, speechifying and gathering volunteers. Claire said Astraea was helping us, and just laughed when the men started calling her 'Saint Claire.'
str_npc_boadice_backstory_b|As I am in need of gainful employment, I cannot be picky over opportunities, despite my royal lineage. I will not, however, tolerate behavior by your troop unbefitting my station. Is that clear?
str_npc_adonja_backstory_c|I've had to sell off all my jewelry just to eat, and I'm tired of being poor. I need loot, Chief, and lots of it, because I can't return to my clan until I have the gold to pay indemnity for each of my men. I'll fight for you if there's a prospect of good loot in the offing.
str_npc_leslie_backstory_c|Shortly thereafter, the Jatu were vanquished by an Adventuring Company and I was freed. Now, I'm stranded here, with no money and no family to help me.
str_npc_ansen_backstory_c|I have no intention of being a priest, but shall learn to be a knight! No more books for me! I'm going to join a band of adventurers or a troop of mercenaries!
str_npc_riva_backstory_c|I am anxious to avoid any further trouble, so if you can tell me of a company of adventurers in which I might enlist, I would be most grateful to hear of it.
str_npc_kassim_backstory_c|Against the day I need no longer beware the Khan's wrath, I would welcome any opportunity to earn a living with my scimitar.
str_npc_lethaldiran_backstory_c|I also know well the use of poisons, the garotte, the art of slitting a throat silently. If there are any little annoyances plaguing you, I could eliminate them for you easily.
str_npc_jocelyn_backstory_c|I am highly trained with lance and blade. I would be an asset to any troop in need of experienced knights. I stipulate only that I be permitted to challenge the Heretics we encounter whenever possible.
str_npc_alistair_backstory_c|You have no more reason than I to love the Order of the Dawn. What say we join forces to combat them? I am highly skilled with blade and lance, have a fine warsteed and will fight under your command for suitable remuneration. I am also trained in tactics and siegework. I will not, however, serve under a bleeding-heart who shows mercy to those murdering bastards of the Dawn, so if you are in league with them, I withdraw my offer to join you.
str_npc_rayne_backstory_c|I hope to offer my sword to some worthy captain, as that is the only honorable profession possible for a landless man of noble birth. In the interim, I dwell amongst thieves, vagabonds, merchants, and the detritus of the road.
str_npc_julia_backstory_c|Our fight ended with Julius dead and me hunted by the Legionnaires for his murder. I fled Janos, hired out as a guard for a travelling merchant and earned my living as a caravan guard. As a girl, I hated the drills my father put me through, curse his hide, but now I'm grateful for them. Have you need for a skilled fighter?
str_npc_frederick_backstory_c|You will find in Pendor no man equal to me in the wielding of a Great Sword, and few with more battle experience or knowledge of tactics. My sword is Mettenheim-forged and of a quality your Pendor smiths only dream of.
str_npc_ediz_backstory_c|You behold in me a stalwart warrior, not a caravan-raiding mercenary, as too many of my people have become. I will fight for no Rogue Knight.
str_npc_sara_backstory_c|Which reminds me, I find myself in a slightly difficult predicament, due to a misunderstanding. A rather handsome young man has become infatuated with me, and is relentless in pursuit of his desires. I must leave this town immediately, as the young man is the Lord's son. As we speak, his men are searching for his 'beloved.' I'd prefer not to be captured or forced to win my freedom with my rapier.
str_npc_donavan_backstory_c|If you know of a commander who prefers to win battles, rather than mollycoddle his soldiers, I would be grateful if you'd direct me to him.
str_npc_diev_backstory_c|So here I am, looking for a commander who's not some effete, noble prick, but a brave and honest warrior. I'll not fight under a noble's command again. 
str_npc_alyssa_backstory_c|I undersstand how my fellow SSerpent Cultists think, and can aid your sstrategies againsst them as well as assissting you in combatting them.
str_npc_roland_backstory_c|My Order also has proclaimed me a thief, since I took with me my Order-provided shield and sword. Before I left the Order of the Dawn, I excelled in all aspects of my training, and was elevated to the rank of Paladin. They may have outlawed me, but they cannot strip me of the rank I gained by my achievements. I remain true to Astraea's teachings and the vows I swore to her.
str_npc_kaverra_backstory_c|Couple days later, they got some ale as loot, and 'course the greedy hogs drank it all on the spot. Soon's they passed out, snoring like pigs, I tied 'em all up with my rope. Then I gelded every last one of the bastards and left them tied up to bleed to death where they lay.
str_npc_sigismund_backstory_c|Our band learned how to fight through experience, and soon enough, we started winning. Our loot armed and equipped us right, and we kept things downright safe over a fair area for a couple of years. They started calling me the 'Hero of Madigan' as our fame spread. Anyway, our success along the coast caught the attention of a powerful Vanskerry Jarl, who decided to take us down. My men were mowed down like hay. My brave Claire refused to give up, and challenged the jarl to single combat. He killed my love in less than ten minutes, despite the fierce fight she put up.
str_npc_boadice_backstory_c|I am highly-skilled and well-armed, and enjoy battle - as do all of my royal line. I come from generations of Veccavian soldiers.
str_npc_adonja_backstory_later|I've sold everything I had but my horse and weapons. I'm in debt to the innkeeper here and he's implied I'll have to pay the bill on my back, if I don't pay in denars soon.
str_npc_leslie_backstory_later|I sold my boots and have managed to make a few denars peddling goods from village to village, but it's dangerous and the profits are paltry.
str_npc_ansen_backstory_later|I've hired out as a scribe and journeyman merchant to some passing caravans, and that at least keeps me fed. However, the work offers no future and life on the road is very boring.
str_npc_riva_backstory_later|I went back home and did some hunting. I still plan to make a name for myself that will cause men to quake in fear when they hear it. I have yet to do that, so here I am again, looking for work.
str_npc_kassim_backstory_later|I have travelled through this soft-bellied land, hoping to eat the salt of a fierce and affluent Khan.
str_npc_lethaldiran_backstory_later|I do the odd job from time to time, but I'm tired of looking over my shoulder all the time. You never know, I might well take to soldiering under the right captain.
str_npc_jocelyn_backstory_later|Good day to you, {reg63?Sir:Madam}. I still seek a worthy captain to follow. Will you not make a place in your company for me?
str_npc_alistair_backstory_later|I came to Pendor with the Order of Eventide, to battle those sanctimonious Twits of the Dawn. We rid ourselves of them in Barclay by inflicting them upon Pendor! Have you realized yet how valuable an addition to your party I would be?
str_npc_rayne_backstory_later|I've offered my sword to a few lords, but found they're shy of my affiliation. They ask me to train peasants, deliver letters, or do other work unbefitting a Knight.
str_npc_julia_backstory_later|I don't know if I told you, but my father was later arrested by the Legionnaires and hung from the South Gate as a warning to all Snake Cultists. The nobles he guarded fled and haven't been seen since. I haven't returned to Janos to see if there's still a price on my head. That seems rather pointless now.
str_npc_frederick_backstory_later|I still seek a captain worthy of my skills, since I have had no word from Mettenheim and no new delegation has arrived.
str_npc_ediz_backstory_later|I have as yet found no aid in reclaiming my lost honor and prefer not to die fighting solo in the attempt, thank you. I still wish to join your men.
str_npc_sara_backstory_later|I have drifted through Pendor, leaving behind a string of love-sick men, and some very angry women. I weary of such easy challenges, and have lately considered turning my hand to more martial pursuits.
str_npc_donavan_backstory_later|I have gone from castle to court, but I have yet to find a lord to my liking.
str_npc_diev_backstory_later|I've paid part of my keep here by 'hunting', but the Lord is on to me now, and I can't hunt as often. Other than that, I'm still looking for the right commander.
str_npc_alyssa_backstory_later|The Sserpent Cult made yet another attempt on my life only yessterday, Captain. I musst request that you allow me to join your company, for my own ssaftely as well as your benefit.
str_npc_roland_backstory_later|I continue my quest to restore justice to Pendor, in the hope that mine will be the final blow struck against injustice and thereby the means of Astraea's return. Though the Knights of Dawn have been expelled from Barclay and inflicted upon Pendor, I alone continue the true quest of the Order.
str_npc_kaverra_backstory_later|There's a few more bastards missing the family jewels since I saw you last, if that's what you mean.
str_npc_sigismund_backstory_later|You again, huh? Nothing's changed since I saw you last. I kill, I drink and I mourn. I hire out as a mercenary. I get paid and I drink. When the money's gone, I hire out again.
str_npc_boadice_backstory_later|I do not find poverty entertaining in the least, good captain, and must again request that you allow me to join your company.
str_npc_adonja_backstory_response_1|How can I know you won't try to loot from us, or desert my troop the first time we engage a pack of Mystmountain Raiders?
str_npc_leslie_backstory_response_1|Well, perhaps I could offer you work. Can you fight?
str_npc_ansen_backstory_response_1|Well, as a matter of fact, I run a mercenary company.
str_npc_riva_backstory_response_1|I run such a company, and might be able to hire an extra blade.
str_npc_kassim_backstory_response_1|I'd consider hiring you, if I can be sure you'll not desert if we have to fight the D'Shar.
str_npc_lethaldiran_backstory_response_1|I might find you useful, if I thought I could trust you.
str_npc_jocelyn_backstory_response_1|If you ride with us, I can promise you a surfeit of Heretics to kill, and perhaps your pursuer will be amongst them.
str_npc_alistair_backstory_response_1|It would be solely on condition that you swear to refrain from annoying any knights in my party.
str_npc_rayne_backstory_response_1|Perhaps you would like to join my company for awhile, Sir Knight.
str_npc_julia_backstory_response_1|If you're looking for work, I can use experienced fighters.
str_npc_frederick_backstory_response_1|I suppose age and experience have a certain advantage over youth and enthusiasm.
str_npc_ediz_backstory_response_1|If you really wish to regain honor, not just to die, I'll consider it.
str_npc_sara_backstory_response_1|I might be able to use an extra sword in my company.
str_npc_donavan_backstory_response_1|My lot could certainly use a bit of discipline and some more training.
str_npc_diev_backstory_response_1|Hmm, are you quite sure you won't turn tail when my troop gets into a fight?
str_npc_alyssa_backstory_response_1|If I recruit you and see even one sign of snakeish behavior, you're out!
str_npc_roland_backstory_response_1|We have much in common, good Sir. Shall we combine forces and fight together to vanquish the evils overtaking Pendor?
str_npc_kaverra_backstory_response_1|That's hilarious! Are you looking for work? My troop fights Vanskerries whenever we encounter them.
str_npc_sigismund_backstory_response_1|My troop specializes in killing bandits, Mystmountain Raiders and Vanskerries. You could earn money and loot while avenging your Claire, if you joined my troop.
str_npc_boadice_backstory_response_1|I suppose your battle skills might outweigh your royal hauteur.
str_npc_adonja_backstory_response_2|I'm sorry, my dear, but I cannot recruit a Mystmountain Raider. My men would be furious.
str_npc_leslie_backstory_response_2|Unfortunately, your tale is not at all uncommon these days. I hope your fortunes improve in future.
str_npc_ansen_backstory_response_2|Go back to your abbot, lad. Soldiering is a hard profession and not one that can be learned from reading old scrolls.
str_npc_riva_backstory_response_2|No, sorry, I haven't heard of one.
str_npc_kassim_backstory_response_2|So you've not only annoyed your Khan, but also have an entire D'Shar tribe after you. I've no desire to mix in D'Shar blood feuds.
str_npc_lethaldiran_backstory_response_2|Sorry, my pointy-eared friend. You sound like trouble on the hoof to me.
str_npc_jocelyn_backstory_response_2|I'm sorry, Sir Knight, but I've already too many in my troop who fight for personal reasons.
str_npc_alistair_backstory_response_2|I'm not sure I could stomach being around you for more than five minutes.
str_npc_rayne_backstory_response_2|Some of my best friends are 'vagabonds,' and 'detritus of the road,' I'll have you know. Good day to you, sir.
str_npc_julia_backstory_response_2|You'll end with your head in a noose, as you richly merit. How could you kill own brother?!
str_npc_frederick_backstory_response_2|I'm sorry, but there are too many would-be commanders in my troop already.
str_npc_ediz_backstory_response_2|I don't want a suicidal tribal maniac in my troop, sorry.
str_npc_sara_backstory_response_2|No, I'm sorry but I can't take you on. You'd create absolute mayhem in my troop.
str_npc_donavan_backstory_response_2|I'll let you know if I hear of anything. Good day.
str_npc_diev_backstory_response_2|I'm sorry, but you're not the sort I want in my troop. I must be able to count on my men.
str_npc_alyssa_backstory_response_2|I don't think I could stand listening to your accent long enough to enlist you.
str_npc_roland_backstory_response_2|I'm very sorry, Sir Knight, but I fear you'd prove too virtuous for my lot.
str_npc_kaverra_backstory_response_2|Sorry, lass, you're a right one, but you'd scare my men half to death.
str_npc_sigismund_backstory_response_2|I've no room in my troop for a drunken whinger, but I do wish you better luck in future.
str_npc_boadice_backstory_response_2|I'd not enjoy having your royal self in my ranks, madam.
str_npc_adonja_signup|Look, Chief, your troop's your clan, your family. You don't steal from your family and you don't desert them in a fight. That's our Catsclaw Clan code and I live by it. If I join up with you, you're my Chief and your troop's my clan.
str_npc_leslie_signup|Well, I'm not a soldier by trade, but I can usually discourage the odd lowlife who's too interested in my bodice.
str_npc_ansen_signup|Do you? I've been hoping to meet someone like you! I would be pleased to join you.
str_npc_riva_signup|Good! I look forward to vanquishing your enemies and spreading the renown of both our names.
str_npc_kassim_signup|Why, that is a most generous offer, assuming, of course, that you are as affluent as you are fierce.
str_npc_lethaldiran_signup|Well, Captain, hire me, and my loyalty is yours, so long as you pay me. Beyond that, I make no promises.
str_npc_jocelyn_signup|My sole desire is to purge Pendor of the heretical foulness springing up like poisonous mushrooms throughout the land. Well, and to avoid the Order of Eventide, of course.
str_npc_alistair_signup|How can you continue to cavil when the prospect of having me amongst your knights is dangled before you? Don't be such a cretin.
str_npc_rayne_signup|If that is a firm offer, I will accept it, my good {reg63?Sir:Lady}.
str_npc_julia_signup|You can? Well, that has possibilities!
str_npc_frederick_signup|I am the finest swordsman in all the Forlorn Hope regiment, and you would be a fool not to enlist me!
str_npc_ediz_signup|How many times must I tell you that I am not your average Singalian mercenary, damn it?!
str_npc_sara_signup|Indeed? Your enlistment of me would be of mutual benefit. I will sing epic quatrains of your exploits whilst slaying your enemies with panache.
str_npc_donavan_signup|I would be pleased to ride with you, at least for a little while, for pay and a share of any loot.
str_npc_diev_signup|Get this, Captain, I'm no coward. I've skills with a bow you've not yet seen, I use my warhammer with lethal accuracy and I'm a strong fighter.
str_npc_alyssa_signup|I sshall endeavor to resstrain what you term my 'ssnakeish behavior' if I join you, though if you arouse my ssnakeish temper, well...
str_npc_roland_signup|Perhaps. But I warn you, commit injustice or fall into lawlessness and I will no longer ride with you.
str_npc_kaverra_signup|I could be, long's you tell those randy louts in your troop that if they get familiar with me, they'll find themselves minus the family jewels, slit from gullet to navel, quicker'n a fisherman can gut a fish.
str_npc_sigismund_signup|You could be right about that, Commander. Perhaps by joining your troop, I can find true purpose again. At least I'll have a justifiable reason for killing.
str_npc_boadice_signup|I will make every attempt to show you proper respect, Captain. Please be aware that doing so will not come naturally to me, however.
str_npc_adonja_signup_2|I'm the best of shots with my bow, quite good with my blade and a fine rider. I can find loot even when it appears there is none. I'd be an asset to your troop.
str_npc_leslie_signup_2|I'm a fast learner. I can ride, and I know trading and prices. You won't find a more conscientious quartermaster anywhere.
str_npc_ansen_signup_2|I would be a most valuable addition to your ranks. I am well-versed in the medical sciences and could serve as a medic to your troop. More importantly, I will happily learn everything you are willing to teach me.
str_npc_riva_signup_2|Note however. that as one gently born, I shall not be a maid, cook or servant. I shall be your comrade-in-arms only and I expect to be treated as such.
str_npc_kassim_signup_2|I shall not betray you  so long as you honor a Khan's duty, by paying me amply and regularly, and allowing me the opportunity to loot. You must also refrain from dragging me into battles there's no chance of winning. Please offer me salt - it is a D'Shar custom to eat salt from the hand of our Khan, as a pledge of loyalty.
str_npc_lethaldiran_signup_2|I can throw daggers, shoot accurately, am excellent with a sword, and I'm as slippery as quicksilver. You'd find me useful both in and out of a fight, I'll warrant.
str_npc_jocelyn_signup_2|Lead on, {reg63?sir:madam} Captain, I pledge my arms and my loyalty to you. May Astraea send us a good supply of Heretics to fight!
str_npc_alistair_signup_2|It is high time you came to your senses. I do trust your stupidity is not as evident when it comes to command in battle.
str_npc_rayne_signup_2|I am a Knight, and prefer only to consort with those of my rank. It will not shame me to serve with an experienced captain, regardless of birth, assuming your followers are not overly familiar with me. I trust that will not be a problem?
str_npc_julia_signup_2|You won't regret taking me on, Captain, I'm deadly with a crossbow. I can hit a snake or a noble's black heart at a hundred paces. Please let me make one thing clear - I take my orders from you, and you alone, not whatever noble you may hire out to.
str_npc_frederick_signup_2|I followed orders for many years before I gave them, Captain, and will do likewise with your orders to me.
str_npc_ediz_signup_2|So long as you do not run from battle or display cowardly behavior, I shall fight for you faithfully.
str_npc_sara_signup_2|I may appear slight of frame, but my blade is as deadly as my tongue! I am an expert equestrienne, and have some additional skills that you may find... interesting.
str_npc_donavan_signup_2|I am a skilled swordsman, and I can also train and drill your men. I warn you in advance, however, that I will not serve under a leader who is lax in disciplinary matters, for no true soldier respects a soft hand.
str_npc_diev_signup_2|My Sergeant said I was the best bowman in the Guard, and I'd make Sergeant myself some day, if I kept increasing my fighting skills. Give me a chance, and I'll prove my bravery to you.
str_npc_alyssa_signup_2|Ssurely you can ssee the benefit to having one of my ssort in your company?
str_npc_roland_signup_2|I'll concede that, together, we might accomplish more in the name of justice, than I may as a solitary Paladin, particularly now that I have left my Order.
str_npc_kaverra_signup_2|Point me at a Vanskerry Raider, Captain, and I'll give you a castrated corpse!
str_npc_sigismund_signup_2|I, Commander Sigismund Sinclair, pledge myself to fight at your side against any enemies you care to challenge.
str_npc_boadice_signup_2|I was a soldier before I was a queen, captain, and you will not find in me one who cannot follow an order. Assuming, of course, that it is a reasonable order.
str_npc_adonja_signup_response_1|Very well, I've reservations, but I'll give you a chance. Prove me wrong and you're out of my troop instantly.
str_npc_leslie_signup_response_1|Well, that's a start. I doubt your armor-covered bodice will provoke much interest.
str_npc_ansen_signup_response_1|Good. We'll teach you to fight, never fear. Pack your gear and meet me at the front gate.
str_npc_riva_signup_response_1|Very well. I'm honored that you deign to join us, um, 'my Lady.'
str_npc_kassim_signup_response_1|Certainly. Please eat of my salt.
str_npc_lethaldiran_signup_response_1|It sounds like you can do an interesting variety of jobs. I will hire you.
str_npc_jocelyn_signup_response_1|You'll make a fine addition to my troop. With us, you'll find both protection and revenge.
str_npc_alistair_signup_response_1|Very well, you may join us. See to it that you behave yourself.
str_npc_rayne_signup_response_1|You will be the equal of every member of my troop, or leave us. I don't like snobs.
str_npc_julia_signup_response_1|Very good. Glad to have you with us
str_npc_frederick_signup_response_1|All right, all right, Forlorn Fred, you may join us.
str_npc_ediz_signup_response_1|I might find a 'tribal maniac' to be a distinct asset in my mercenary company.
str_npc_sara_signup_response_1|Good. Please remember my men are hired for fighting, not flirting!
str_npc_donavan_signup_response_1|Good. I'm pleased to hire someone like you.
str_npc_diev_signup_response_1|All right, you have your chance. I warn you though, falter even slightly in battle, and you're sacked.
str_npc_alyssa_signup_response_1|This is against my better judgement, but all right, I'll take you on.
str_npc_roland_signup_response_1|We are in agreement, then. My hand and word on it, Sir. Do try not to judge my men too harshly.
str_npc_kaverra_signup_response_1|You're hired. I'll make absolutely sure the men understand that!
str_npc_sigismund_signup_response_1|I accept you into my troop. Go put your head under the pump. If I catch you drunk on duty, you're out.
str_npc_boadice_signup_response_1|Welcome to my company, 'Your Majesty.'
str_npc_adonja_signup_response_2|I'm very sorry, my dear, but you're too risky a proposition for me.
str_npc_leslie_signup_response_2|I'm sorry, but I'm looking for fighting experience, not trading skills. Good day to you.
str_npc_ansen_signup_response_2|I'm sorry, but I'm looking for accomplishments somewhat different from yours.
str_npc_riva_signup_response_2|Actually, I'm not in the habit of hiring bandits with invented pedigrees. Good day, madam.
str_npc_kassim_signup_response_2|On second thought, I don't want D'Shar in my troop. Sorry.
str_npc_lethaldiran_signup_response_2|My men will never trust a Noldor. Sorry, but no.
str_npc_jocelyn_signup_response_2|I'm sorry, Sir, but I can't afford to pay more knights just now.
str_npc_alistair_signup_response_2|I will hire your smarmy, blackhearted self the day that Hell freezes over.
str_npc_rayne_signup_response_2|Your assumption is off the mark, Sir. In my company, noble birth counts for nothing. We respect courage and skill.
str_npc_julia_signup_response_2|On second thought, I value those of noble blood in my company too highly to risk hiring you. Good day.
str_npc_frederick_signup_response_2|Sorry, but I can't afford your services at present.
str_npc_ediz_signup_response_2|I cannot collect every tribal stray in Pendor, so I must refuse.
str_npc_sara_signup_response_2|On second thought, I think you are far too dangerous to have in my company.
str_npc_donavan_signup_response_2|I don't want to provoke a mutiny in my ranks, so I must decline. Good day, sir.
str_npc_diev_signup_response_2|I'm sorry, but you just won't fit into my troop. Good luck in finding a good commander.
str_npc_alyssa_signup_response_2|Frankly, I'd rather kill you where you stand than hire you.
str_npc_roland_signup_response_2|I'm sorry, but my company is not sufficiently virtuous for a knight like you.
str_npc_kaverra_signup_response_2|Sorry, I can't risk losing even one man, and at least one of them is sure to offend you.
str_npc_sigismund_signup_response_2|There's no place in my troop for a drunk. Sorry.
str_npc_boadice_signup_response_2|Sorry, 'Your Highness,' the answer's no.
str_npc_adonja_payment|Er, Chief, there's the problem of my bill here at the inn. Could you spare {reg3} to settle it?
str_npc_leslie_payment|.
str_npc_ansen_payment|.
str_npc_riva_payment|Excellent. Before we depart, would you kindly lend me {reg3} denars? I had to pawn a family heirloom here, and I would like to retrieve it before we leave.
str_npc_kassim_payment|Thank you. Now, to seal our alliance, I ask for {reg3} denars. It's advice my father gave me - 'Never fight for a non-tribesman unless {reg63?he:she} pays your worth in gold up front'.
str_npc_lethaldiran_payment|Well, then, all I need is a payment of {reg3} denars, and you have your very own Noldor assassin!
str_npc_jocelyn_payment|Captain, I must request the sum of {reg3} before I can join you, as I need to repurchase my horse from the market here. He's a fine steed, and I'd very much like to buy him back.
str_npc_alistair_payment|I do require a paltry {reg3} denars, of course, before I join you. If you cannot afford my services, I quite understand.
str_npc_rayne_payment|That's very good of you. Before I join, could you lend me {reg3} denars to pay the innkeeper, who has boarded me on credit these last few months?
str_npc_julia_payment|That's good news, but I'll ask for one last thing, Captain. I have to pay some debts here in {s20}, and I always pay what I owe. Can you spare {reg3} denars?
str_npc_frederick_payment|Mijn Commandant, I request the sum of {reg3} denars as an enlistment bonus. I am highly qualified and well worth that sum.
str_npc_ediz_payment|Honored Captain, I have debts to pay and must request the sum of {reg3} denars before I join your followers.
str_npc_sara_payment|Before I formally join you, there is the small matter of the expenses I've incurred while staying here -- {reg3} denars. Could you cover my bill for me, as a gesture of friendship?
str_npc_donavan_payment|Ah, one last thing. I require an initial bounty of {reg3} denars before I join your command. I never enter someone's service without receiving an advance payment.
str_npc_diev_payment|So, Commander, will you pay my bill here? What with my hunting, it's only {reg3} denars.
str_npc_alyssa_payment|{playername}, I musst inssisst that you pay me {reg3} denarss for an enlisstment bonuss, ass I musst pay ssome debtss before I depart with your troop.
str_npc_roland_payment|My good {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, I must ask for a signing payment of {reg3} before I can join you. I wish to send payment to my Order for my horse and equipment, that they may no longer accuse me of theft.
str_npc_kaverra_payment|Captain, would you advance me {reg3} against my pay? I want to pay my old master for his goods, since I never got them to market, and he can't afford the loss.
str_npc_sigismund_payment|Commander, can you pay me a signing bounty of {reg3}? I've run up a bit of a reckoning in the tavern here.
str_npc_boadice_payment|I must request that you pay me the sum of {reg3} denars, as I require some gold immediately.
str_npc_adonja_payment_response|Here's {reg3} denars. And call me 'Captain,' dammit, not 'Chief' - I'm not some bloody Raider Chieftain!
str_npc_leslie_payment_response|.
str_npc_ansen_payment_response|.
str_npc_riva_payment_response|Certainly. Here's {reg3} denars.
str_npc_kassim_payment_response|Well... here's {reg3} denars, then. Your first payment.
str_npc_lethaldiran_payment_response|Very well, here is {reg3} denars and you'd better be worth it!
str_npc_jocelyn_payment_response|Certainly, Sir Knight. I feel the same way about my own horse. Here's {reg3} denars.
str_npc_alistair_payment_response|Damn, you value yourself highly! All right, I agree to {reg3} denars.
str_npc_rayne_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} denars.
str_npc_julia_payment_response|Of course. Here, {reg3} denars.
str_npc_frederick_payment_response|All right, but you'd best be every bit as fine a soldier as you say!
str_npc_ediz_payment_response|All right, here is {reg3} denars.
str_npc_sara_payment_response|Of course, here's {reg3} denars. Make ready to leave soon.
str_npc_donavan_payment_response|All right, here's {reg3} denars. You are most welcome to the company.
str_npc_diev_payment_response|Very well, I'll pay it, but you'd best prove worth the investment.
str_npc_alyssa_payment_response|Very well, here are {reg3} denars as your enlistment price.
str_npc_roland_payment_response|Whew! Well, I suppose a Paladin does not come cheaply. Here is {reg3} for your Order.
str_npc_kaverra_payment_response|Certainly. Here's an advance of {reg3}.
str_npc_sigismund_payment_response|Please tell me that isn't just your bar bill! I'll pay {reg3} to the innkeeper.
str_npc_boadice_payment_response|I suppose hiring a queen for that price is fair enough. Your {reg3} denars.
str_npc_adonja_morality_speech|Chief, er, Captain, when we {s21}, that isn't good for the clan, er, troop morale and I don't like it.
str_npc_leslie_morality_speech|I hope you don't mind my saying so, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, but I hate it when we {s21}. Maybe I ought to be harder, but if we could show a little mercy from time to time, I'd sleep better. I do not want us to be like the Jatu, who revel in killing.
str_npc_ansen_morality_speech|Perhaps I am out of line to say this, my {reg63?Lord:Lady}, but I confess I'm shocked that we {s21}. I realize that war is cruel, but we need not make it even more vicious.
str_npc_riva_morality_speech|Your pardon, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, for your information, those of my house do not {s21}. I will not be pleased if you follow a similar course in future.
str_npc_kassim_morality_speech|Please listen to me, {reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}. It is not good to {s21}. Your first duty is to the men who have taken your salt. The least they can expect is food, pay, the opportunity to loot, and that you not waste their lives needlessly.
str_npc_lethaldiran_morality_speech|Captain, we Noldor do not {s21}. I suggest more cunning and less blundering about the battlefield next time...
str_npc_jocelyn_morality_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, what the devil are you up to? How did you manage to {s21}?
str_npc_alistair_morality_speech|Well, I'm surprised you'd {s21}! Not to mention the fact that the entire troop's honor is sullied by your actions.
str_npc_rayne_morality_speech|My good {reg63?Sir:Lady}, I cannot condone the way we {s21}. Knights of my Order cheerfully accept death, but never dishonor. Please do not make me ashamed that I serve under you.
str_npc_julia_morality_speech|Begging your pardon, {reg63?Lord:Madam} Captain. I can't say that I'm happy to see us {s21}. Those are just simple people, trying to make a living. If we could go easier on the poor wretches, Captain, I'd feel much better.
str_npc_frederick_morality_speech|Mijn Commandant, I must protest such unmilitary behavior as when we {s21}! I am not pleased with your actions.
str_npc_ediz_morality_speech|I will not again tolerate such cowardly behavior - to {s21} is an anathema to my people!
str_npc_sara_morality_speech|My Captain, if we can avoid it, I'd prefer not to {s21}. Pendor is a small place, and my reputation is precious to me. I would be mortified if one of my rivals turned this unfortunate incident into a satirical song.
str_npc_donavan_morality_speech|I will not again {s21}. No one with a reputation for such behavior can be properly feared or respected by his men.
str_npc_diev_morality_speech|Dammit, Commander, I may have been a poacher, but I never in my life would {s21}.
str_npc_alyssa_morality_speech|Whyever did you {s21}? Your behavior is dissgraceful! I am embarrassed to be part of this troop.
str_npc_roland_morality_speech|Excuse me, my good {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain. I joined forces with you to fight lawlessness and injustice, not to {s21}! I refuse to take part in such an action again.
str_npc_kaverra_morality_speech|Captain! I don't care to {s21} and you need to know that right now! It ain't like you to do something like that and I hope you'll never do that again!
str_npc_sigismund_morality_speech|Commander, what in hell are you thinking of, ordering our troop to {s21}? That is absolutely disgraceful!
str_npc_boadice_morality_speech|You managed to {s21}, Captain and I am most disappointed in you.
str_npc_adonja_2ary_morality_speech|Look here, Chief, er, Captain, I'm ashamed that we should {s21}. Such an action reflects badly on the troop.
str_npc_leslie_2ary_morality_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam}, I'm not altogether happy that we should {s21}. I'm a merchant, and our words are our bonds. I don't want a reputation for dishonesty -- that is fatal to a trader.
str_npc_ansen_2ary_morality_speech|My {reg63?Lord:Lady}, I think your decisions that led us to {s21} disgraceful. Such actions do not sit well with me.
str_npc_riva_2ary_morality_speech|Your pardon, I don't approve that you {s21}, despite whatever necessity led you to it.
str_npc_kassim_2ary_morality_speech|{reg63?Bahadur:Bibi} when you order us to {s21}, it touches upon my honor as a D'Shar. I am displeased.
str_npc_lethaldiran_2ary_morality_speech|Captain, just so you know, I don't mind that we {s21}. They'd likely do the same to us given half a chance.
str_npc_jocelyn_2ary_morality_speech|I am a Knight, not a coward, as some in your troop most certainly are, and based on the fact that you {s21}, you are not far from one yourself!
str_npc_alistair_2ary_morality_speech|Have you lost your remaining feeble wits, to {s21} like that? Really, you astonish me at times.
str_npc_rayne_2ary_morality_speech|My good {reg63?Sir:Lady}, I am dismayed that you {s21}. A {reg63?gentleman:lady} should adhere to the highest standards at all times.
str_npc_julia_2ary_morality_speech|{reg63?Lord:Madam} Captain, I dislike the fact you managed to {s21}. If you treat your men well, they'll repay you with interest.
str_npc_frederick_2ary_morality_speech|You {s21} when a little perseverance and some better tactics might have won the day. I am disgusted.
str_npc_ediz_2ary_morality_speech|My captain, to {s21} is worse than killing from the shadows! I came to Pendor to regain my honor, not to sully it!
str_npc_sara_2ary_morality_speech|O Valorous one, you disappoint me when you {s21}! I would be ashamed to write a ballad about that sort of action!
str_npc_donavan_2ary_morality_speech|I hardly expected that you would {s21}, Commander, and I can't say I'm pleased with what you did.
str_npc_diev_2ary_morality_speech|So, you decided that to {s21} was your best course of action? I can't say I agree with you.
str_npc_alyssa_2ary_morality_speech|In the Sserpent Cult, one who chooses to {s21} would be conssidered unworthy even as a ssacrifice to Azi Dahaka.
str_npc_roland_2ary_morality_speech|That you would {s21} saddens me deeply. I thought better of you.
str_npc_kaverra_2ary_moralilty_speech|I know I wasn't raised no lady, but I know right from wrong, same's any hoity-toity noble, maybe better. I wouldn't {s21} and you shouldn't either.
str_npc_sigismund_2ary_morality_speech|No decent commander would {s21}! You've disappointed me badly this time.
str_npc_boadice_2ary_morality_speech|A Veccavian commander would fall on her sword before committing such an act - she'll never {s21}. You are a disgrace to the name of Captain!
str_npc_adonja_personalityclash_speech|Chief, er, Captain, I don't appreciate that {s11} constantly refers to me as 'that Raider wench' and makes a show of checking his purse when I'm around.
str_npc_leslie_personalityclash_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam}, {s11} is a sadistic little pervert who probably tortures puppies and pulls the wings off flies in his spare time. I wish you'd just get rid of him.
str_npc_ansen_personalityclash_speech|Captain, {s11} is both patronizing and downright rude to me, and I must protest the fact that she calls me 'young Ansen' and 'silly boy.'
str_npc_riva_personalityclash_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam}, my lineage is above reproach, my house is one of the most ancient and respected in Pendor. Yet {s11} openly shows me disrespect, and casts doubt on my background.
str_npc_kassim_personalityclash_speech|A moment of your time, {reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}, if you please. {s11} calls me a common bandit, because I have occasionally raided the odd caravan passing through my family's lands. She said she wished I'd tried to raid her caravan, because then she could have gelded me. This is an offense to my honor as a D'Shar.
str_npc_lethaldiran_personalityclash_speech|Oi, Captain, do you really want that insane tribal savage, {s11}, in this troop? Even for a human, he seems unusually crazy. It appears he just wants to get killed anyhow, and I've no mind to join him in his suicide!
str_npc_jocelyn_personalityclash_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, had I known you intended to enlarge your ranks via the recruitment of poachers and guttersnipes, I'm not sure I'd have joined you. {s11} will no doubt end pilfering all our baggage and disappearing.
str_npc_alistair_personalityclash_speech|Really, Captain, confess, don't you find {s11} to be a crashing bore on the subject of Astraea? I am also quite tired of his moans about the decline in virtue of his order and the iniquities of mine. He is utterly misguided, as well as a bore, you know.
str_npc_rayne_personalityclash_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam}, {s11} is a silly old geezer who fancies himself yet a soldier. He persists in offering me unwanted and unnecessary advice on fighting techniques, and I must request that you order him to refrain from doing so!
str_npc_julia_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me, captain. I hate to trouble you with complaints, but I must tell you that I can't abide {s11}, that bandit whore who pretends to be of noble blood.
str_npc_frederick_personalityclash_speech|Mijn Commandant, if {s11} makes one more impolite remark to me about my age or fighting abilities, I intend to decapitate him. He will then find out first-hand that I have yet the strength to wield a Great Sword. I apologize in advance if this causes you inconvenience.
str_npc_ediz_personalityclash_speech|Why would you enlist an assassin like {s11}, let alone a Noldor?! No wonder he was exiled by his people. What true warrior would stoop to skulking in shadows to kill an unsuspecting victim from behind? Not one with whom I care to associate, I can tell you!
str_npc_sara_personalityclash_speech|Captain, I cannot comprehend why you enlisted {s11}, that fugitive - if she is actually a fugitive and not a spy - from the Snake Cult. We don't want or need that sort of villainy in this troop. She is also utterly creepy!
str_npc_donavan_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me, captain. During our last fracas, I told {s11}, that utterly incompetent merchant, to hold the line and not go haring off after a foe on her own. Her response to me was that I should insert my orders into an unmentionable location! I will not tolerate such disobedience again!
str_npc_diev_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me, Captain, but {s11} is an arrogant prick, and I don't care for his manner to me. He just informed me that he does not care to associate with one who would be better employed poaching deer than wielding a weapon in battle. I hope you don't mind that I told him what he could do.
str_npc_alyssa_personalityclash_speech|Captain, if {s11} were as tireless in purssuit of enemies as sshe iss of bed partners, every one of your foes in Pendor would lie dead! You musst speak to her and demand that she cease these ssluttish habitss!
str_npc_roland_personalityclash_speech|My good {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, I must protest the inclusion of {s11} in our party. He masks his little comments as jokes, but those jokes sow distrust and dissension amongst the ranks.
str_npc_kaverra_personalityclash_speech|Captain, that {s11} is a D'Shar piece of horse dung, and he's got no manners, neither. He said my Man Opener was just a woman's toy and I should be in a tent as a concubine, not out fighting men's battles!
str_npc_sigismund_personalityclash_speech|Commander, {s11} is an arrogant wench who thinks a few sorties with a pack of Raiders made her a soldier. When she was piddling in her diapers, I was killing Mystmountain Raiders, and I'm only sorry I didn't run into her father before he sired her!
str_npc_boadice_personalityclash_speech|Captain, it is one thing to be forced to associate with mixed ranks and quite another to be on equal terms with a merchant's son who fancies himself a healer! No one of my rank permits a male to attend her wounds and I'd appreciate your informing the little twerp of this!
str_npc_adonja_personalityclash_speech_b|When he's not saying rude things about me, all he does is whine about his lost love and get slobbering, knee walking drunk. If that woman Claire was still alive, she'd likely have murdered him by now, as I may well do myself.
str_npc_leslie_personalityclash_speech_b|Where does he get the right to issue orders during battle? You're the captain of this troop. He also threatened to whip me and was practically drooling at the prospect!
str_npc_ansen_personalityclash_speech_b|I am aware that she claims to be queen of an island where women dominate. It is a pity courtesy was no part of her royal upbringing. If I do not tend her wounds, who will?
str_npc_riva_personalityclash_speech_b|{reg63?Sir:Madam}, its a sorry day indeed, when common folk feel free to mock their betters. That is all.
str_npc_kassim_personalityclash_speech_b|With your permission, I shall deal with {s11} as we deal with impertinent women in my tribe. After giving her a good beating, I will cut out her tongue. You may then cast her out from this company in disgrace.
str_npc_lethaldiran_personalityclash_speech_b|I thought you humans had at least some sense of humor! Every time I tell a funny story, he looks at me like I was some sort of criminal and mutters about dishonor. What the hell's his problem, anyhow and why does he have to be such a sarcastic bastard?
str_npc_jocelyn_personalityclash_speech_b|I have warned him to avoid my company assiduously, if he values his continued good health, and must request that you convey to him that I mean it! If I catch him poking about in my baggage, he's a dead man.
str_npc_alistair_personalityclash_speech_b|Aside from putting me and half the troop to sleep with his stultifying proselytizing about Astraea, and his endless pursuit of virtue, he persists in vilifying my Order quite unjustly, and it makes others in this company distrust me.
str_npc_rayne_personalityclash_speech_b|He'd do better to switch to a Bastard sword - age is robbing him of the strength to wield a Great Sword, in my opinion. He is also a braggart and I find his tales of Mettenheim's glory abominably repetitive.
str_npc_julia_personalityclash_speech_b|She's nothing but a brigand, as far as I can tell. Genuine blue-bloods are bad enough, they lie, cheat and steal. Bandits pretending to be blue-bloods are even more intolerable. I might have said something a bit sharp to her a minute ago. She seemed offended, anyway.
str_npc_frederick_personalityclash_speech_b|That young upstart fancies himself an experienced knight, but his brashness will get him killed long before he is old enough, if he could even qualify with his current skills, for a regiment such as the Forlorn Hope.
str_npc_ediz_personalityclash_speech_b|That shifty Noldor even takes gold for his dishonorable murders. I find this completely contemptible and would like your permission to challenge him, just to see if he can fight like a man, instead of a viper lurking under a rock.
str_npc_sara_personalityclash_speech_b|How you can tolerate her hissing is beyond my understanding. Why don't we just cut off her head like any snake's and be done? It would still keep her forked tongue, at least.
str_npc_donavan_personalityclash_speech_b|Her back will stripe as prettily as any soldier's, Captain, and if she suggests again that I torture puppies for fun, she'll rue the day she opened her insolent mouth.
str_npc_diev_personalityclash_speech_b|He's just the sort of high-nosed noble prick I despise, giving himself airs because of his blood, not his actions. I was only accused of desertion - - he admits to it!
str_npc_alyssa_personalityclash_speech_b|Her behavior leadss otherss in thiss troop to think that all females in your company are like her, and I for one, dislike ssuch comparisonss.
str_npc_roland_personalityclash_speech_b|He's a slimey little bastard and the living - at least for the moment - representation of all I despise about his heretic Order. He drops his snide, barbed little remarks into all conversations. He is undermining our company's morale, and you should sack him immediately before his poison spreads.
str_npc_kaverra_personalityclash_speech_b|He says that again, I'll fix him with my 'woman's toy' and we'll see what his tribe thinks of a warrior who sings soprano.
str_npc_sigismund_personalityclash_spech_b|You mark my words, she'll be off one night, with everything of ours not nailed down, running straight back to her mountains, to share her spoils with her thieving clan.
str_npc_boadice_personalityclash_speech_b|He may be skilled, as such skills are rated amongst Pendorians, but his skills mean nothing to me. He is not female and he may not attend me.
str_npc_adonja_personalityclash2_speech|Chief, er, Captain, I know {s11} was orphaned in a raid, but it wasn't me leading it and he acts as if was. They've killed as many of my clansfolk in Ravenstern as ever we killed raiding there, and I wish you'd tell him he'd better quit mouthing off to me about the fact that I hail from the Mystmountains like it was something bad.
str_npc_leslie_personalityclash2_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam}, {s11} talks just like a Jatu and he has no respect for women. When he learned what happened to my brother and me, he looked me up and down, and said I'd make a passable third or fourth wife to some tribesman, so long as my face was covered.
str_npc_ansen_personalityclash2_speech|My {reg63?Lord:Lady}, that hopeless Mettenwiener, {s11}, grows annoying. All he does is tell me I will never make a knight, because I didn't start training at a young enough age. I told him if he thought I needed more training, I'd gladly learn from him, and he just laughed and told me to run along and read another book.
str_npc_riva_personalityclash2_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam}. I happened to exchange a few words with {s11} as we were dividing up the spoils of battle. Please inform him that, when he addresses me, he may not call me 'wench', 'human female' or 'dagger-bait.'  He should address me as 'Lady Riva' or 'Riva Blackwolf.'
str_npc_kassim_personalityclash2_speech|{reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}, {s11}, the peddler, is useless to this company. When next we encounter Ramun, you should sell her off as a slave, as she is fit only for concubinage.
str_npc_lethaldiran_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, {s11} is an insufferable prima donna about the way I address her and also my profession. I ask you, what's wrong with providing a valuable service for a price?  There's plenty in Pendor want killing, that I can tell you, starting with her! How does a bandit slut qualify to criticize a Noldor, I ask you? 
str_npc_jocelyn_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, you may find those snarky comments {s11} bestows upon all and sundry amusing, but I emphatically do not! Have you forgotten that he was sent to kill me? I cannot turn my back or get a moment's rest in camp while he remains in this troop!
str_npc_alistair_personalityclash2_speech|Has {s11} come whinging to you about my little jokes? He greatly overstates the seriousness of my Order's and my personal business with him. We wish merely for him to return to the fold, not to harm him in any way. He is very silly to spout his imaginary fears so readily - they are doubtless caused by guilt over his defection from the Order of Eventide.
str_npc_rayne_personalityclash2_speech|My good {reg63?Sir:Lady}, I trust you will not object to my telling you that self-proclaimed Queen of the May, {s11}, needs to learn a bit of respect for the male sex and for knights in particular. Her discourtesy to me passes all bounds!
str_npc_julia_personalityclash2_speech|{reg63?Lord:Madam} Captain, is there a reason you keep {s11} in this troop? Surely this company has no need of a bard whose most notable performances are on her back.
str_npc_frederick_personalityclash2_speech|Mein Kapitan, you do no service to {s11} by encouraging him to try and become a knight. He will never succeed. You should tell him to concentrate on his books and leave sword work to those who know which end of one to use!
str_npc_ediz_personalityclash2_speech|Amongst our people, a woman like {s11} would be ostracized, and never permitted to serve honorably in a company such as this. She should be sacked from this company for her impudence.
str_npc_sara_personalityclash2_speech|Hello, captain! {s11} is an awfully prudish sort, isn't she? I asked her if the Legionnaires' reputation for being absolute studs was justified, and she glared at me and said I was in a better position to know something like that than she was.
str_npc_donavan_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, {s11} is incorrigibly undisciplined. During our last skirmish, I called out to him that he should flank the fellow to the right of me. He informed me that he'd split my skull if I tried to give him another order and followed up this remark with an obscene gesture!
str_npc_diev_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, that Mystmountain Raider of yours, {s11}, is a right pain, and also a danger to this troop. Just you wait, the first time we have to fight any Mystmountain brigands, she'll cut and run straight to their side. You can't trust 'em, I tell you, they're all thieves and murderers.
str_npc_alyssa_personalityclash2_speech|That cretin-in-sshining-armor, {s11}, had the audacity to tell me to my face that he loathes me, my accent and all I repressent. I have a little bit of sserpent venom left and would greatly enjoy putting it into his ale!
str_npc_roland_personalityclash2_speech|My good {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, that pet snake of yours, {s11}, needs its head cut off! She is an invidious influence and all the troop dislike her. We are in the business of killing Snakes, not nurturing them in our bosoms!
str_npc_kaverra_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, that moronic Singalian, {s11}, is an obnoxious bastard. I think you should tell him that he's the only one who cares what he thinks a woman should be doing!
str_npc_sigismund_personalityclash2_speech|Commander, that fellow {s11} is about to get his skull split right down the middle, if he keeps giving me orders during battle. He doesn't know squat about command, anyhow, and I take my orders only from you!
str_npc_boadice_personalityclash2_speech|I understand that you must recruit knights where and when you find them, but surely you could dispense with the services of {s11}! He is priggish, insolent to me, and a complete moron!
str_npc_adonja_personalityclash2_speech_b|He also gave me some claptrap about treating the dead and wounded decently, with respect. Well, I told him, 'They're all quite decently dead now, and I'm looting them respectfully, so bugger off, Poacher, or I'll slit your throat next.'
str_npc_leslie_personalityclash2_speech_b|He threatened to sell me to one of his heathen tribals, the next time we are in D'Shar territory. Please, Captain, don't keep him in this company!
str_npc_ansen_personalityclash2_speech_b|My {reg63?lord:lady}, he disparages my fighting skills and constantly taunts me that I shall never achieve knighthood. I beg you to tell him to desist, or I shall be forced to demonstrate to him what I know of bladework!
str_npc_riva_personalityclash2_speech_b|I am of noble blood, and he is Noldor scum, rejected even by his own house. Please order him to accord me the respect due me from one of his lowly station.
str_npc_kassim_personalityclash2_speech_b|{s11} has the heart of a mouse, and fewer fighting skills than a dung beetle. Though her merits are few, she is at least a woman, so perhaps a tribesman too poor to buy a proper wife might give a lame horse in trade for her. You should look into this, {reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}, the next time we cross D'Shar lands.
str_npc_lethaldiran_personalityclash2_speech_b|Why does a perfectly competent bandit wench prefer to be called a lady? Some of these human habits are quite bewildering. Surely she should be proud of her true profession.
str_npc_jocelyn_personalityclash2_speech_b|He resembles a cross between Screwtape and Uriah Heep! His smarmy innuendos will bring about his death, and not in battle, mind you. If you won't make him close his evil mouth, I will!
str_npc_alistair_personalityclash2_speech_b|So sad, that a Knight of Eventide should be reduced to a timorous crybaby with no sense of humor, isn't it? I do believe you've been a bad influence on him.
str_npc_rayne_personalityclash2_speech_b|I admit that {s11} is brave in battle, but courage is not the only attribute of a true queen.  I must also confess that hearing of her treatment of men on Veccavi makes me cringe, and she exploits this regularly when she addresses me!
str_npc_julia_personalityclash2_speech_b|In the Empire, women are valued for their honor and virtue and she implied that I had none! She actually implied that I might know something about the bed skills of the Legionnaires.
str_npc_frederick_personalityclash2_speech_b|If I had any hope that he was capable of learning how to use his blade, I'd offer to mentor him, but he is best left where he is as a medic and bookworm.
str_npc_ediz_personalityclash2_speech_b|A woman who knows not her place is dangerous and bad luck, Captain. I also do not care for the way she looks at me and caresses that ridiculous weapon of hers.
str_npc_sara_personalityclash2_speech_b|She is not so ugly that I assumed she was without experience, but I suppose I was mistaken. The Legionnaires are likely more discriminating in their tastes than to traffic with her sort, though perhaps she was better-looking when she was younger.
str_npc_donavan_personalityclash2_speech_b|Commander, this sort of undisciplined behavior gets soldiers killed. It puts not only him, but all those around him in danger. Defiance of authority is a corrosive influence in any company, but especially in one like this, with so many divergent backgrounds. I shall flog him, despite his threats, if he ignores me again.
str_npc_diev_personalityclash2_speech_b|We don't need a Mystmountain Raider in this troop any more than a boar hog needs teats. Have you seen the way she slices into dead enemies? Disgusting! I spoke to her about it, and she threatened to slit my throat, barbarian that she is.
str_npc_alyssa_personalityclash2_speech_b|I promisse only to poisson him a little, jusst enough to teach him a lesson. Oh, pleasse, it would not harm him to sspend an evening examining the contents of his sstomach!
str_npc_roland_personalityclash2_speech_b|It makes me physically ill to hear her speak in that hissing manner she affects. I can scarce restrain my constant urge to kill her! I do so only because of my respect for you, but even that respect has limits.
str_npc_kaverra_personalityclash2_speech_b|He told me he don't care to associate with peasants who would never be allowed to call themselves warrior women in his clan. He says the Singalians divide women up early into servant, wife and warrior classes, and they are never allowed to change.
str_npc_sigismund_personalityclash2_speech_b|Next time he mentions flogging in my presence, he'll get to know what a flogging can do, all right. I'll stripe him like a zebra with his own damned whip, then put his whip where the sun don't shine!
str_npc_boadice_personalityclash2_speech_b|When the gods created cretins for comic relief on earth, he must have been their prototype! Were he not so obnoxious, he would be amusing. Unfortunately, his obnoxiousness outweighs his amusement value. He needs gelding to quiet him down.
str_npc_adonja_personalitymatch_speech|Chief, er, Captain, I'd have {s11} with me on a raid any day of the week, despite his bookishness. His shyness is rather appealing, too. I think he might have a crush on me.
str_npc_leslie_personalitymatch_speech|Do you know, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, {s11} is an interesting man. We've had the odd chat and the more I know of him, the better I like him. He truly cares about those less fortunate than he is.
str_npc_ansen_personalitymatch_speech|My {reg63?Lord:Lady}, {s11} is as gallant in battle as she is beautiful. Do you think she'd ever look at a man like me? I try to engage her in conversation, but I always get the impression she is laughing at me.
str_npc_riva_personalitymatch_speech|Excuse me, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, I'd like to say a word in praise of {s11}. For all he's a D'Shar, he did well in that last battle.
str_npc_kassim_personalitymatch_speech|That was a fine battle, {reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}. {s11} is a spirited warrior and most enjoyable to fight alongside.
str_npc_lethaldiran_personalitymatch_speech|Oi, Captain, I was just having a chat with {s11}. I never cared much for those of the Empire, considering the Noldor history with them, but exceptions seem to be the rule in this company.
str_npc_jocelyn_personalitymatch_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, {s11} is most skilled in battle as well as a bladeswoman of merit. We need more like her in this troop. I notice she has a strong grasp of tactics, as well.
str_npc_alistair_personalitymatch_speech|I must admit I find our little serpent {s11} quite amusing, and she's rather alluring, too. Her wit is as sharp as the proverbial serpent's fang as well. Did you hear what she said to a Questing Knight we passed on the road yesterday? I laughed myself silly over it.
str_npc_rayne_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, {s11} acquitted himself well in that fight back there. Though he's only a Singalian, he doesn't want for courage, and he's very skilled.
str_npc_julia_personalitymatch_speech|Hail, {reg63?lord:madam} Captain, I wish you joy of your victory! Say, {s11} lives up to the Noldor reputation of being unstoppable warriors, doesn't he?
str_npc_frederick_personalitymatch_speech|At least one other member of your troop is a professional soldier. We would welcome a man of the caliber of {s11} into the Mettenheim army.
str_npc_ediz_personalitymatch_speech|Were he of Singalian blood, I would welcome {s11} into my clan. His honor matches our own and he fights most fiercely.
str_npc_sara_personalitymatch_speech|You have earned your name in a song today, O Valorous One! And {s11}, too! I like that one. Though he's undoubtedly a rough diamond, I find myself wondering if I should try to refine him. He might prove worth the effort.
str_npc_donavan_personalitymatch_speech|Captain. I must say that it is a pleasure going into battle with men like {s11} at my side. Mettenheim trains fine soldiers, and I admire him immensely.
str_npc_diev_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, {s11} has a kind heart and a sweet nature. She's the sort of person we're fighting to keep safe, and I admire her gentleness. She'll make a fine wife to some lucky fellow one day.
str_npc_alyssa_personalitymatch_speech|I musst admit, I find {s11} ssomewhat entertaining and he iss handsome, too. He iss a welcome relief from the dour and tedious memberss of thiss troop.
str_npc_roland_personalitymatch_speech|My good {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, I must tell you that I admire {s11}'s strength and grit, particularly considering what happened to her. She does not bewail her circumstance - she fights, and fights well.
str_npc_kaverra_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, that {s11} is all right. When one of the men was bothering me, he told him to take himself off, and told me to sit by him in camp, and he'd see to it nobody harassed me again.
str_npc_sigismund_personalitymatch_speech|Say, Commander, that {s11} is rightly named a 'Fox,' I can tell you. She's a great entertainer, in more than one way, if you take my meaning.
str_npc_boadice_personalitymatch_speech|Had I met more men of {s11}'s sort before, I might have had to revise my opinion of men. Such a pity he is a man - he'd otherwise make a fine commander.
str_npc_adonja_personalitymatch_speech_b|I never thought I'd grow to like a man like him - shy, always reading - did you know he offered to teach me to read? Vejovis amuses himself at our expense sometimes, I suspect.
str_npc_leslie_personalitymatch_speech_b|He's the kind of man my brother was, protective of women, with nice manners. I feel safe fighting beside him.
str_npc_ansen_personalitymatch_speech_b|I've never been around a girl like her. I was never interested in the ladies of Cez - too airheaded. When I try to talk to her, my tongue just ties itself in knots, though, and I'm sure she thinks I'm an idiot.
str_npc_riva_personalitymatch_speech_b|You chose well, when you enlisted him in our company. He knows a thing or two about a fight, and also knows the importance of respecting his comrades-in-arms, unlike some others I might mention. He comes from an ancient family, too, you know.
str_npc_kassim_personalitymatch_speech_b|As for her claims of nobility, I doubt that {s11} is any more nobly-born than I am, but I greatly admire her fire and spirit. If I did not fear waking with my throat slit, I would carry her off to my family's tents as my first wife.
str_npc_lethaldiran_personalitymatch_speech_b|Have you heard her story? Imagine having to kill one's own brother after finding one's whole family was enmeshed with the Snake Cult! Of course, a lot of the Empire Citizens are Snakes on the sly, I'm told. Still, she did very well.
str_npc_jocelyn_personalitymatch_speech_b|I'd like to have seen her at the head of that Veccavii army. I'd also wager she'd make a far better queen of her island than that sister of hers!
str_npc_alistair_personalitymatch_speech_b|Perhaps you should recruit more Serpent Priestesses to your company. They would certainly add a bit of leavening to this very dull group.
str_npc_rayne_personalitymatch_speech_b|Were he of noble blood, I'd offer him membership in the Order of the Falcon. It is a pity that he is Singalian. Still, he is a worthy comrade in arms.
str_npc_julia_personalitymatch_speech_b|He covered my back in our latest battle, and saved me an injury or worse. It goes to show that prejudice is often misplaced - you'll never hear praise of the Noldor in the Empire.
str_npc_frederick_personalitymatch_speech_b|We of the Forlorn Hope admire nothing more than genuine military ability, coupled with fine fighting skills.
str_npc_ediz_personalitymatch_speech_b|I have four sisters, three of whom were too young for marriage when I left. I wonder if he would care to marry into my clan? A brother-in-law of Outlander blood would not be unheard of amongst my people.
str_npc_sara_personalitymatch_speech_b|He is a fine man I think, despite his crudities and his drinking habits. I am very glad that he is with us, Captain. I can sense that his hard exterior disguises both gentleness and true passion. He interests me as no man has before. I must beware liking him too well.
str_npc_donavan_personalitymatch_speech_b|He's a professional soldier, and despite being of middle age accounts for many on the battlefield. He knows the wisdom of holding together in a disciplined battle-line, too. You showed excellent sense in adding him to the company.
str_npc_diev_personalitymatch_speech_b|Her example gives me the strength to keep fighting for the underdogs, even with all the odds against winning.
str_npc_alyssa_personalitymatch_speech_b|Amongst sso many knights who bore on forever about the godss and their tiresome virtues, his wit iss like the ssparkle of ssunlight on water.
str_npc_roland_personalitymatch_speech_b|I must admit that, although her nickname and weapon are somewhat offputting, she is a fine soldier. Despite her peasant birth and upbringing, she has noble principles and a fine sense of justice. She is one of nature's nobles.
str_npc_kaverra_personalitymatch_speech_b|He treats me like a lady, too, and tells me 'bout his goddess, Astraea, who sounds like the right kind of goddess to me. He said she might have sent those Vanskerries to me as a trial of my courage and I came through it bravely.
str_npc_sigismund_personalitymatch_speech_b|Those songs she makes up about our troop's adventures are great listening. Just watching her move is a real pleasure. Beats me how she can be both a superb armful and one hell of a soldier, all in one package.
str_npc_boadice_personalitymatch_speech_b|When I regain my throne, I might consider bending our rules about males just a trifle, so as to put him into my army. Ungelded, of course.
str_npc_adonja_retirement_speech|Chief, er, Captain, I miss the snow and my mountains, and I really miss my Clan. I'd like to try to get back to them, so I think I'll head out now. If we meet in a fight, I'll call off my men, if you will, and we'll each go our separate ways. I wouldn't feel right fighting you.
str_npc_leslie_retirement_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam} I have seen more bloodshed than I can bear. I've money now to return to Barclay, and I'll never soldier again. Goodbye, and thank you for rescuing me from that tavern.
str_npc_ansen_retirement_speech|I have decided that a warrior's life is not for me. I'd like to rejoin my abbot and resume my studies. I am sorry to fail you, my {reg63?Lord:Lady}.
str_npc_riva_retirement_speech|I have fought with you honorably, as befits my status and name. However, neither you nor your troop have accorded me proper respect. I will go elsewhere and find a captain who shows respect both for me and for my abilities.
str_npc_kassim_retirement_speech|{reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}, I ate your salt, and I have fought for you fiercely and loyally, and the loot has been abundant. I wish to return home now, in hopes that the Khan's men have forgotten me, to see my father and brothers again. Khuda Hafiz.
str_npc_lethaldiran_retirement_speech|While I greatly enjoy your company, Captain, I cannot say the same for that of the majority of your troop. I must bid you farewell.
str_npc_jocelyn_retirement_speech|Captain, I weary of taking orders when I am more accustomed to giving them. I'm going to form my own troop, which I alone will command. I thank you for the time we have fought together, and I will always remember you kindly.
str_npc_alistair_retirement_speech|Despite my very best efforts, you remain nauseatingly virtuous, and I fear I can no longer tolerate your company. I shall continue the mission with which my Grand Master entrusted me, and I advise you to beware of me in future.
str_npc_rayne_retirement_speech|We have fought well together, and earned ourselves much glory. I do, however, have an Order to refound, so I leave you now. Perhaps we will meet again some day.
str_npc_julia_retirement_speech|I've had enough of tramping up and down the length and breadth of Pendor. I've got enough to buy a little house in a town somewhere, so I think I'll look for a job as a tavern guard, so I can sleep with a roof over my head once more. Bye, and best of luck to you.
str_npc_frederick_retirement_speech|Mijn Commandant, I have had word that a delegation from Mettenheim has arrived in Pendor and I must now join them lest I be charged with desertion from the Forlorn Hope. Farewell.
str_npc_ediz_retirement_speech|Captain, I have, thanks to your leadership, recovered my honor. I wish now to seek out my people before I become to accustomed to Outlander ways.
str_npc_sara_retirement_speech|Your renown increases with every battle, and I fear that my own reputation will pale in comparison, as the moon is outshone by the sun. I have decided to strike out on my own. I shall sing of your exploits wherever I go, O Valorous One!
str_npc_donavan_retirement_speech|I hereby inform you that I am severing our relationship. I have found alternative employment with one less soft on {reg63?his:her} men.
str_npc_diev_retirement_speech|Commander, my parents, the ones who adopted me, are getting old. I had word from the Master of that last caravan we escorted that they want to see me. I owe them, for rescuing and raising me, and I want to go back to Rane and see what I can do for them.
str_npc_alyssa_retirement_speech|I have received a letter from the SSerpent Cult sstating that all will be forgiven if I return to them. I think I sshall go back, ass I do not like being part of your troop.
str_npc_roland_retirement_speech|My good {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, it is time for me to leave you. I am better-suited to being a solitary Paladin, I fear, than a member of this unruly troop.
str_npc_kaverra_retirement_speech|Captain, I got enough loot put by to start up again as a peddler. You know that's all I wanted, anyhow, and thanks to you, I got skills enough to keep from being raided without one hell of a fight. So, I think I'll be off and try my hand at trading again. Maybe we'll meet up again one of these days.
str_npc_sigismund_retirement_speech|Commander, I think I've finally had my fill of fighting. My farm's going to hell back home, and I'd like to take up my plow again. What's past is past and it's time I moved on. I'll never have my Claire again, but she had a younger sister, who may not be married yet.
str_npc_boadice_retirement_speech|It is high time I began assembling an army to take back my throne in Veccavi. Thanks to you, I have enough loot to hire a goodly force, so I must say farewell to you now.
str_npc_adonja_rehire_speech|Chief, er, Captain, well met! I was hoping to find you again. I never made it back to my mountains, got jumped and robbed on the way, so here I am, broke again, looking for work. Will you hire me back? Same terms, just let me at the loot!
str_npc_leslie_rehire_speech|{reg63?Sir:Madam}, I've been looking for you everywhere! I bought a load of goods, and took them back to Barclay. But, without my brother I had no reason to stay, so I've returned here to my true friends. Tavern gossip has it that you've done very well for yourself. So tell me, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, may I return to you as quartermaster?
str_npc_ansen_rehire_speech|Hello, {reg63?Sir:Madam}! It is very good to see you again. I have not fared well since we parted, I'm afraid. My abbot was not very welcoming. I receive nothing but lectures from my father and brothers. I am better suited to war than to commerce, to sharing meals over a campfire with fellow soldiers than sipping wine with the burghers of Cez. {reg63?Sir:Madam}, will you please take me back?
str_npc_riva_rehire_speech|Why hello, Captain, you've done well for yourself, I hear. Since we parted, I've been unsuccessful at making my name and fattening my purse. I know there's been bad blood between us, but if you can forget that, I'd be honored to fight in your ranks once again.
str_npc_kassim_rehire_speech|{reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}, your fame grows ever greater and has spread throughout my homeland. I went home, hoping that the Bahadur Khan had forgotten my little exploit, but alas, he has not. Before I reached the Pamirs, word came from my family that both the Khan's men and the Yusafzai were looking for me. I have returned, hoping to fight in your warband once more.
str_npc_lethaldiran_rehire_speech|Captain, how delightful to bump into you again. I have not received sufficient commissions to make a decent living. The loot with your company was far better, and I would like to join you again.
str_npc_jocelyn_rehire_speech|Well met, {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain! I've discovered that there are more benefits to being under the command of a good Captain than there are in commanding a troop. If you'll have me back, I should like to rejoin you.
str_npc_alistair_rehire_speech|My Grand Master thought my departure from you overhasty and has ordered me to find and rejoin you. I trust you will welcome my return?
str_npc_rayne_rehire_speech|Captain, it is good to see you again. I sought service with several lords, but have been most disappointed in them. They ask me to collect debts from their fellow lords, as though I were a banker's errand boy, or order me to chase down their runaway serfs, as though I were a farm overseer. One even asked me to murder one of his creditors! I have looked for you, to ask if I might join you again.
str_npc_julia_rehire_speech|{reg63?Lord:Madam} Captain, it is so good to see you! I found I'd no taste for staying in once place all the time. Breaking up tavern brawls is much more dangerous than fighting a battle! I'm a soldier now, for better or worse.  So tell me, Captain, are you looking for more troops at the moment?
str_npc_frederick_rehire_speech|I begin to despair, Mijn Commandant. When I went to join the latest Mettenheim delegation, I arrived too late. They fell afoul of a band of Heretics and were all slaughtered. Is it possible that I might rejoin your troop?
str_npc_ediz_rehire_speech|When I returned to my home tents, all were deserted. Only one old man remained, half-crazed, but he finally told me the entire clan had left for the deep desert to join some fanatic named Burilgi. May I rejoin the troop?
str_npc_sara_rehire_speech|Hello there, O Valorous One. I've been hoping you'd appear again. Everywhere I go, I hear tales and songs of your deeds. I admit to feeling a trifle jealous of your renown, but I've since regretted our parting. I'd like once again to fight by your side, to add my moon's silver light to the gold of your sun. Shall we ride together again, if only for a little while?
str_npc_donavan_rehire_speech|Captain, it's good to see you. When last we parted, I'd have sworn by all the little gods that I'd not serve under you again, but perhaps I judged you too harshly. All over Pendor, men sing your praises. I have tried serving in other lords' armies, and believe me, what I have seen of them raises my opinion of your leadership. If you'll have me in your company, I'll fight for you again.
str_npc_diev_rehire_speech|Commander, glad I bumped into you again. By the time I got back to Rane, my mother was already dead, and my father was going fast. The business had gone to hell, too, and I had to sell off what was left to pay their debts. Now I'm looking for work again - are you by any chance hiring just now?
str_npc_alyssa_rehire_speech|That letter from my cult wass a trap, Captain, and I narrowly esscaped with my life. I sshall not make ssuch a misstake again, if you will let me sserve with you again.
str_npc_roland_rehire_speech|My good {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, I regret parting company with you. I realize that I judged you and your men too harshly, by knightly standards, and failed to take into account that your men are simply soldiers. I have heard of your recent exploits and wished I had been again amongst your valiant company. Would you consider permitting me to rejoin you?
str_npc_kaverra_rehire_speech|Hey, Captain, been lookin' for you all over. Peddling's kinda boring, and I ain't hardly had a chance to use my Man Opener since I left the troop. You hirin' again? Just sharpened up my Man Opener the other day.
str_npc_sigismund_rehire_speech|Commander, glad you turned up here today. Even as I was leaving, I knew in my heart I'd never make a farmer again. I went back to Vezin, started working my land, and realized I was meant to plant dead men, not seeds, into the ground. Claire's sister is married now, too, she's had three brats and run to fat.
str_npc_boadice_rehire_speech|Hello, Captain. I returned to Veccavi only to find that my sister had consolidated her power most efficiently. My gold was insufficient to hire enough men to fight her, and I once again had to flee my island. Will you have me in your company again?
str_npc_adonja_home_intro|They call them the Mystmountains because, most days, the mist rises so thick on the ground of a morning, you can hardly see your hand before your face. Then the sun burns through the rising haze, and the purple peaks appear beyond.
str_npc_leslie_home_intro|Javiksholm's where my brother and I landed when we first arrived in Pendor. Our hopes were so high and we couldn't wait to start travelling and trading.
str_npc_ansen_home_intro|Can you smell that? Lemon trees, apples and saffron crocus flowers, the scents of Ethos. I spent many a happy summer here when I was studying with the abbot.
str_npc_riva_home_intro|Ah, the Woods of Laria. This place has all sorts of evil creatures lurking in its shadows. There are even shape-shifters here, if you can believe the old tales.
str_npc_kassim_home_intro|{reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}, we are nearing Singal, the largest town in the lower steppe. My mother's sister's husband's cousin came here to marry a townsman. I escorted her, thinking to take service with the Khan of Singal. That, of course, was prior to my small misunderstanding with the Bahadur Khan and the Yusafsai.
str_npc_lethaldiran_home_intro|Hmm, we're a trifle close to my home territory for my comfort, but I admit I've missed these woods. I hunted here often as a lad.
str_npc_jocelyn_home_intro|This is a fine town, filled with handsome houses and prosperous burghers, with a rich trade in furs. I have missed the snows of Barclay.
str_npc_alistair_home_intro|I miss our Barclay banquets. My father used to order criminals and other riffraff tortured during his feasts, and their shrieks of agony quite stimulated my appetite. His torturer was exceptionally skillful.
str_npc_rayne_home_intro|Behold the walls of Rane, the strongest fortress in all Pendor. My father spent many summers here, jousting for the honor of the Knights of the Falcon in the tournaments held here. He won ten tournaments straight in his youth, a record that stands to this day.
str_npc_julia_home_intro|Ah! Do you smell that fresh air, Captain? This was my home, before I left under the circumstances we previously discussed. It's good to be here again, though it brings me bittersweet memories. Somewhere near is the cave I hid in, the first month after I left Janos.
str_npc_frederick_home_intro|There is too much fresh air in Pendor. I miss the smoke and acrid scents of smelting ore, the clang of weapons being forged. I find I do not care for the odors of dung and fresh-plowed earth.
str_npc_ediz_home_intro|In the deep desert, the vistas are endless; an eternity of sand broken only by gusts of wind, the tracks of sand snakes and bones left by the vultures. It is stark, but very beautiful.
str_npc_sara_home_intro|Ah, such a lovely spot, here by the deep lake. I spent many a happy day here, the summer before last.
str_npc_donavan_home_intro|Do you see that fortress over there? I spent a winter there some years back, trying to train the lord's men.
str_npc_diev_home_intro|Rane's a fine town, for all the poor outnumber the rich by fifty to one. I had some fine times with what a lord would call 'riffraff' here, I can tell you. Each time I shot a wild boar or a deer in the Lord's preserve, we'd feast in the alleys.
str_npc_alyssa_home_intro|I miss the Sserpent Temple, with its undulating carvingss and the quiet there. I also greatly miss my little pet. He wass emerald color, with ssilvery eyes and coiled about my neck like a necklace more beautiful than any jewel.
str_npc_roland_home_intro|I was born near Cez, as I may have told you. It's a beautiful city, bustling with traders, with the lapping of the waves as background music. Marius has done much for it, most particularly in his efforts to drive out the accursed Snake Cult. Our shrines are to Damia Provideo, the original Pendor godesss.
str_npc_kaverra_home_intro|We're near my home village, Captain. It's just a fishing village, but we made a good living before the Raiders started coming so often. Jayek has a fleet of twenty fishing boats, you know, the biggest village fleet in the Fierdsvain.
str_npc_sigismund_home_intro|That's my village, just over the next hill. I can smell the new-turned earth already; they must be plowing today. Thanks to us in no small part, they can plow in safety, with a fair chance of getting a good harvest from their labors.
str_npc_boadice_home_intro|The longer I stay in this revolting land, the more I miss my island. Our weather was quite temperate, and I slept each night with the sound of waves for a lullaby. I should like to command an army again, as well, rather than simply being a common trooper.
str_npc_adonja_home_description|Vejovis appears in the form of a mountain cat, but only to our shamans. When the shamans see Vejovis, they know he's telling us it's time for another foray, and he'll watch over us while we're raiding.
str_npc_leslie_home_description|People say the Fierdsvainers are barbarians, but they have good heads for trade. The people up and down the coast grow flax, which they weave into linen. It can't compete with Janos silks and velvets as a luxury fabric, but it makes good summertime wear, as well as sails for ships. Linen was one of the few goods that someone else in Pendor wasn't already making.
str_npc_ansen_home_description|Ethos has wet winters and hot summers, but the people here build great cisterns to water their crops. They grow wonderful grapes - Ethosian wine is famous, my {reg63?Lord:Lady}. Those who can afford it have walled gardens, where fruit trees grow in abundance. We'd sit at night listening to music, or playing chess, or just enjoying the sweet scents of the night air.
str_npc_riva_home_description|The King of Sarleon declared this to be his personal hunting preserve, and said he'd hang anyone who as much as strung a bow here. What's the result? A family grows hungry, and the father poaches to feed them. The Lord's Sheriff hangs him, and takes his land. His sons, rather than starve, turn bandit. Naturally, anyone in the valley escaping a debt, a nagging wife or a vengeful noble comes up here and joins them, living on wild pigs, berries and the purses of unwary travelers.
str_npc_kassim_home_description|The D'Shar have long come here, to trade and raid, and in the last days of the Kingdom of Pendor, we began to settle. Our ancestors took the King's coin to keep the other tribes at bay. We began trading and built settlements to protect our markets. Those settlements became the cities that you see today. Odd that a nomadic people could tolerate living in the same place for even a week, let alone centuries.
str_npc_lethaldiran_home_description|I do find it difficult being surrounded by humans, rather than amongst my own kind. Have you any idea how foul most of you smell? Noldor cleanliness standards are vastly higher than those of humans.
str_npc_jocelyn_home_description|I've grown to like snow here in Pendor, so now I enjoy crispy air and the feel of a cold day, the sound of snow crunching beneath my horse's hooves. My energies wane in warmer climes. It is a pleasure to ride in snow again.
str_npc_alistair_home_description|His torturer used to flay them, layer by layer, and could make them last throughout the feast. He was quite talented. What delightful evenings they were!
str_npc_rayne_home_description|I have often wondered if Rane's glory influenced my father's choice of name for me, his only son. I never asked him, and now that he's dead, I cannot. It is a fine name though, don't you think? Too bad that I am the last, both of my Knighthood Order and of my line. I alone am charged by the gods to restore my order, and I cannot rest until I have done so.
str_npc_julia_home_description|It was one of the most frightening times of my life. The Snake Cult was everywhere back then, currying favor with their foul God in revolting ways. No one was safe. Marius changed all of that, and good for him. He is the only noble I'd say is worth a damn. Still, I don't doubt he has an evil side as well. All nobles keep dark secrets and stain their souls with treachery.
str_npc_frederick_home_description|I would give much to see Mettenheim again, to walk its rocky tracks, to see our great volcano belching smoke to rival the smoke of our forges.
str_npc_ediz_home_description|I'd like to ride once again across the desert with my clanbrothers at my side, rivalling the wind itself with our speed.
str_npc_sara_home_description|Once, I came here with a small group of friends for a picnic. There were ten of us, two ladies, seven young lords and me. We were attacked by a coven of Heretics, who thought we'd be easy pickings. Two of the lads fled straight away and the others proved no match for the coven. The two young ladies and I were left with five bloodthirsty Heretics who planned to sacrifice us on the spot. The only sacrifices made that day were the lives of those Heretics!
str_npc_donavan_home_description|I say 'trying' because, in my opinion, the men of Ravenstern don't understand discipline. They are undoubtedly the finest archers in Pendor, and good riders too, but they've no talent for fighting in ranks. Their skills serve them well enough against bandits and Mystmountain Raiders, and against an army when they're behind walls. Get them outside the walls, though, and a company of heavy lances can cut through a Ravenstern formation like a knife through butter. For my money, the Empire produces the best soldiers. Their Pikemen and Legionnaires are the most disciplined soldiers I have encountered outside Barclay.
str_npc_diev_home_description|It's a crime, it is, that a few in Rane are so rich, when so many go hungry every day. I despise those fat Lords and merchants, who sit gorging on food they don't need, while brats in the alleys cry from hunger and steal garbage to eat.
str_npc_alyssa_home_description|We sspend our days in quiet contemplation of the greatness of Azi Dahaka, broken only by forays to obtain fressh ssacrifices.
str_npc_roland_home_description|We were on our way to the Harvest Festival when the Serpents took my parents. I still remember those festivals, Damia's shrine heaped with ripe ears of corn, everyone celebrating the end of a good harvest. Musicians came from miles around and there was dancing in the town square at night.
str_npc_kaverra_home_description|My granfer used special woods to smoke our fish, gave it a taste no other smoked fish had, and brought us a better price from the traders. I heard tell that even the King used to ask for Jayek smoked fish for his table. Far's I'm concerned, if I never eat another fish, it'll be too soon.
str_npc_sigismund_home_description|I'd give all I have, if I could once again be a simple village farmer. End of the day, I'd take my Claire's hand and lead her home, and never leave. If she even mentioned soldiering, I'd shut her mouth with a kiss right quick, and tell her home's the place for people like us.
str_npc_boadice_home_description|A balmy wind would carry the rattle of palm fronds and the scent of our gardens throughout the city. I was given only the greatest respect by our male slaves, utterly unlike the disrespect shown me by the ungelded clods here in Pendor.
str_npc_adonja_home_description_2|The feel of an icy mist on your face wakes you up right in the morning. I'm tired of warm weather. I'd like to see the snow on my mountains again.
str_npc_leslie_home_description_2|My brother and I had saffron, cinnamon, cloves, pepper and other spices and a chest full of denars. From Javiksholm, we travelled towards Laria, to trade for Noldor artifacts and pottery. We estimated that, even if we couldn't find artifacts, we could buy linens, furs, velvet, iron and wool, the extra horses to carry them back to Javiksholm, and still make a profit. If only we'd taken the Jatu into account!
str_npc_ansen_home_description_2|The poets call Ethos a paradise, and I think that, for once, they do not take poetic license.
str_npc_riva_home_description_2|I know this because I was taken by bandits, and held for ransom, but I got away. That's really all there is to tell.
str_npc_kassim_home_description_2|Our famous D'Shar warrior poet, Khushal Khan Khattack was born here. This is one of the best lines from his immortal verse: 'My soul rejoices as my scimitar reddens, sticky with the blood of my enemies; I gain strength from my kills and my wounds are as nothing. I laugh with delight as the vultures devour their rotting dead.'
str_npc_lethaldiran_home_description_2|I also miss our music - your clumsy pipes and whistles cannot compare to a Noldor flute, and your croaking is by and large unmelodious.
str_npc_jocelyn_home_description_2|In Barclay as a child, I greatly enjoyed snowball fights. It snows rarely there, so a snowstorm is always a special event to us.
str_npc_alistair_home_description_2|I made full use of our right of jus primae noctis in our villages, as well, since dear Pater was a trifle past such activities, due to his drinking habits. I can safely say that even the plainest virgins went to their marriage beds considerably more experienced than they came to mine. Even the fat ones had a certain cushiony appeal, and they were soft to sleep on when I was done with them.
str_npc_rayne_home_description_2|I spent most of my life in the hall of our Order in Rane, studying and training with sword and lance. I still miss those days and will treasure my memories of them for the rest of my life. Our order was outlawed when Gregory IV assumed the throne over his elder sister, Madame Ursula. She was a knight of our Order, and none could dispute the strength of her arm. Politics in Ravenstern were not always thus. Under the Kings of old, many Knighthood Orders cooperated for the sake of the King and the people. It is a pity those times have gone forever.
str_npc_julia_home_description_2|Before Julius turned evil, we'd hike here to search the ruins for ancient artifacts. We'd find old pottery and other interesting things when we were lucky. Once we found an old dagger buried in the mud. The handle had rotted away, but the blade was as clean and sharp as one new-made. We gave it to my Dad, and I hate to think what he used it for. I hope that priestess lady he guarded died by it. That would be a fitting use for such a blade, wouldn't it?
str_npc_frederick_home_description_2|These paltry hillocks you call mountains here in Pendor cannot compare with the magnificence of our central volcano, Aysenberg, rising like a spire in the center of our island.
str_npc_ediz_home_description_2|I long for the smell of kebab roasting over a dried dung fire, for the nutty taste the dung imparts to the meat. I would kill for a pot of my mother's pulao.
str_npc_sara_home_description_2|When I was done, the ladies were in hysterics and the lads were all wounded. I concocted a tale for their sires of how their valor had saved us all. The lads knew who the real heroine was, but were ashamed to admit that I'd saved all their lives. For the rest of that summer, they went in terror that I'd reveal what had really happened. I thought to make a song about our adventure, but relented in the end, and did not.
str_npc_donavan_home_description_2|If anyone ever unifies Pendor, I'll serve them, free of charge. I'll sail to Barclay, hire a a few companies and bring them back here. Barclay is more advanced than Pendor in the ways of warcraft. A company of Barclay infantry and two companies of Barclay Imperial Lanciers would make the king invincible.
str_npc_diev_home_description_2|Still, I might go back to Rane one day, if only to see how my adoptive parents are. They had a comfortable house and a good life there, and I might have more of a taste for that sort of life now than I had as a lad.
str_npc_alyssa_home_description_2|I am ssick of eating only bread, cabbage and apples! Do these Pendorians grow no vegetables at all?!
str_npc_roland_home_description_2|The Empire celebrates no festivals now, because those filthy Serpent Cultists are everywhere. We must find and kill more of them, Captain, they befoul all Pendor, not just the Empire. Though my loyalty is to my Order, now, I cannot help but mourn what the Empire has become.
str_npc_kaverra_home_description_2|Our fishermen can find schools of fish better'n most. They got a thing called a 'compass' that tells 'em where they are, Granfer got it from some Ravenstern trader. Our farmland's good, too, and Thallo walks our fields each spring. My uncle saw her once.
str_npc_sigismund_home_description_2|I used to hope I'd see Thallo, walking my fields of an early morn, and think she'd maybe give me one of her flowers. Her flowers make the seeds sprout quicker and the harvest heavier, you know, if she gifts a farmer with one.
str_npc_boadice_home_description_2|At the snap of my fingers, a dozen male slaves appeared, all eager to please me. A wave of my hand sent them scurrying to do my bidding.
str_npc_adonja_home_recap|I'm proud to come from the Catsclaw clan, and strong because I grew up in the Mystmountains under Vejovis' protection. If you have friendly enough relations with the tribes, ask me about connections; I might have something that would interest you.
str_npc_leslie_home_recap|I was born over the Western Sea, in the city-state called Barclay. I'm a merchant, the daughter of a merchant, and the granddaughter of a merchant.
str_npc_ansen_home_recap|I was born in my father's house in {s20}, but I spent much of my childhood in {s21}.
str_npc_riva_home_recap|I grew up in a manor just outside Laria. Its nothing like it once was, but it has been in our family for generations.
str_npc_kassim_home_recap|I was born in the high passes on the other side of the Pamirs, past Torbah, but I have relatives in Singal.
str_npc_lethaldiran_home_recap|I am of the House of Ithilrandir and take pride in my ancestry, despite my exile.
str_npc_jocelyn_home_recap|I hope to retire to Barclay and perhaps train the young sons of nobles in the knightly skills. Alas, there is no longer a place within my Order to house me in my old age.
str_npc_alistair_home_recap|Ah, the refinements of Barclay! Pendor's lack of amenities is quite nearly insupportable and I long for the delights and comforts of home.
str_npc_rayne_home_recap|I was born in Senderfall but spent most of my life in Rane, where the Halls of the Order of the Falcon once stood.
str_npc_julia_home_recap|I was born and raised in Janos. Maybe someday I will return.
str_npc_frederick_home_recap|I have nearly lost hope that I will ever see Mettenheim again. I fear they think me dead with the rest of the delegation.
str_npc_ediz_home_recap|The day I ride once again into my home camp with my honor restored will be the happiest day of my life.
str_npc_sara_home_recap|Oh, far away from here, my Captain. I live here and there, but I don't call any place home for very long. That would be too boring.
str_npc_donavan_home_recap|I am the younger son of the Count of Dunglave, whose fief lies northwest of Barclay, across your Western Sea.
str_npc_diev_home_recap|I had some right fine times in Rane, and sometimes I wonder if any of my friends there are still alive.
str_npc_alyssa_home_recap|I would never have tried to poisson my rival, had I known my action would lead to thiss misserable exile in Pendor.
str_npc_roland_home_recap|I recall the scents of Cez, as well, spice, fish, overripe vegetables in the market, overlaid with the scents of the flowers planted in the boxes on the fronts of all the houses.
str_npc_kaverra_home_recap|Sometimes I miss going to sleep to the sound of the waves in Jayek, but that's about all I miss about living in a fishing village. I'd rather gut a man than a fish, any day.
str_npc_sigismund_home_recap|Maybe, one day, I'll go back to Vezin. Still, as they say, you can't turn back time, and nobody gets to go home again. Likely the village wouldn't want a man like me living there anyway.
str_npc_boadice_home_recap|When I rule Veccavi once again, my sister's head shall be the first to roll!

str_npc_adonja_kingsupport_1|Well, you could hardly be a worse ruler than those fools whose backsides currently warm the various Pendor thrones! With you in charge, we could work out a trade deal with the Mystmountain tribes, so our clans could trade in Ravenstern instead of raiding?
str_npc_leslie_kingsupport_1|Captain, I suspect you'd be a fair ruler and rid Pendor of the bandits and invaders who plague caravans and traders? If you did that and set up a proper merchant's guild, maybe relaxed the import tariffs those greedy kings impose, we could make Pendor a very profitable place to trade.
str_npc_ansen_kingsupport_1|Well, my {reg63?lord:lady}, if any person could hold that sort of power and remain uncorrupted, it would surely be you. You've already proved to me that you are not the sort to go to war every five minutes, like the morons who lead the Pendor factions. If you'd further the cause of universal education as well, that would be a fine thing!
str_npc_riva_kingsupport_1|Well, captain, you've shown respect for the well-born like me, and I should think the lords of this land would welcome a {reg63?king:queen} who understood the responsibilities as well as the prestige of belonging to the noble class.
str_npc_kassim_kingsupport_1|A fine idea, {reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}, if you can govern with a strong but even hand on all. So long, of course, as you allow the D'Shar to hold to our ancient traditions and do not attempt to end our blood feuds or favor one tribe over another.
str_npc_lethaldiran_kingsupport_1|You have, by and large, imposed unity on a troop composed of very diverse people, and I think you could do the same for Pendor. If your rule encompassed fairness for my people, too, I'd be pleased to support you.}
str_npc_jocelyn_kingsupport_1|You have been a fine leader of this troop, Captain and I see no reason why you could not rule Pendor. Certainly, eradication of any and all Heretics should be part of your agenda, and I'd support you if you pledge to me you'll do that.
str_npc_alistair_kingsupport_1|You could hardly do worse than Pendor's current rulers. I think I could support you as {reg63?king:queen} of Pendor, assuming you swore to do something to civilize this land!
str_npc_rayne_kingsupport_1|Very good, my {reg63?lord:lady}, you are a fine commander and I think you could rule well. I doubt you'd exile worthy knighthood Orders, either, and if we refounded the Knights of the Falcon, you could command a loyal group of valiant knights as well, {reg63?sir:my lady}.
str_npc_julia_kingsupport_1|Well, Centurion, you know my feelings about nobility, but you've done much to rid the Empire of the Snake Cult, and I think you'd do a better job than that fool, Marius, were you the {reg63?king:queen}. Mind you don't fall into the ways of the nobility, though!
str_npc_frederick_kingsupport_1|Pendor needs a strong ruler, one who can impose order with force but govern with efficiency and kindness. You appear to have the abilities needed. I will support you as Pendor's {reg63?king:queen}.
str_npc_ediz_kingsupport_1|We Singalians killed off our rulers a long time ago, but Pendor appears to need one more than we did. I respect you, Captain, and I will stand behind you as you reach for a crown.
str_npc_sara_kingsupport_1|So you aspire to become a {reg63?king:queen}, O Valorous One? There are many tales and ballads of those who, through wisdom and military skill ascended to a throne. I rather fancy the idea of being a {reg63?king's:queen's} court bard.
str_npc_donavan_kingsupport_1|Well, {reg63?sir:madam}, I've said this before - I'd train men gratis for a ruler who unified Pendor, and I'll hold to my word. I could make your army invincible, given the time, authority and funds.
str_npc_diev_kingsupport_1|You gave me the chance to prove I am no coward, Captain, and my bow is at your service. If you can be fair to the people those lordly bastards consider 'riffraff', I will support you in your bid for the throne.
str_npc_alyssa_kingsupport_1|Yess, you sshow resspect for me, despite your misguided dislike of the Sserpent Cult. Perhapss you might make a good {reg63?king:queen} of Pendor. You could hardly be worse than those who currently rule here.
str_npc_roland_kingsupport_1|You show respect for Astraea and the Pendor gods and have led our troop wisely to many victories. I have noted your personal virtue, as well, and you have gained my respect. I believe you would make a fine {reg63?king:queen}.
str_npc_kaverra_kingsupport_1|What the hell, Captain, why not? With you in charge, them Vanskerries will not dare raid our Fierdsvain villages no more. You let me lead patrols and the bastids will rue the day HafSigla blew 'em onto Pendor shores. I reckon I could give Kodan Ironsword a run fer his money as a patrol captain.
str_npc_sigismund_kingsupport_1|You are not a half-bad commander, Captain. If Pendor was unified, the people could farm in peace, and not fear that all their labor would be lost to squabbling lords and raiders. I coud see my way clear to supporting your claim to the throne.
str_npc_boadice_kingsupport_1|Why not? I would be pleased to advise you on matters which, not being a hereditary {reg63?king:queen}, you may not understand fully. Being a {reg63?king:queen} makes one the slave of the people, rather than the reverse, and it is a great responsibility. I think you could manage it.
str_npc_adonja_kingsupport_2|A {reg63?king:queen} who showed some kindness to us Mystmountain clans, and let us sell our furs and crafts in Ravenstern, maybe allowed us to settle a village or two, would never have to worry much about raids, though a few will always follow our old clan ways, but you know how to deal with them.
str_npc_leslie_kingsupport_2|A wise {reg63?king:queen} looks after the economic interests of the land {reg63?he:she} rules and ensures the trading routes are safe. The common people value stability and prosperity above all.
str_npc_ansen_kingsupport_2|I have a book of Pendor history, my {reg63?lord:lady} which details how the {reg63?kings:queens} of old convened councils of both the lords and representatives of all the Pendor guilds. That council had the power to overrule oppressive taxes or the unfair treatment of a citizen. Were you to form such a council again, you'd be praised by the people.
str_npc_riva_kingsupport_2|Captain, the difficulty will come in persuading the nobility to accept you. As you know, lineage is of great importance to the lords, and even peasants traditionally support only those who are nobly born. Have you a noble Pendor ancestor whom you have not mentioned? Descent from a noble Pendor line would increase the credibility of your claim.
str_npc_kassim_kingsupport_2|By Vata, yes, {reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}. In those far-off days when our clans came first to Pendor, we had the right to live as nomads, shifting our herds to different pastures over the seasons. If our tribes heard directly from you that our ancient rights would be restored, you would gain much respect from them. We are ever a traditional people and a Bahadur Khan who turned a blind eye to the odd raid or a small blood feud would be highly regarded by the tribes.
str_npc_lethaldiran_kingsupport_2|I would. I still have friends amongst my people, despite my exile, and I'd let them know that our position would improve under your governance. I'll also watch your back most carefully - you'll need a good assassin in your court!
str_npc_jocelyn_kingsupport_2|I will assuredly do that, Captain. My ex-Order, of course, will make trouble for you, but the rest of Pendor's Orders can be brought to support you with a bit of persuasion.
str_npc_alistair_kingsupport_2|I would, but on condition you promise to permit me to introduce customs to your new court suitable to a proper {reg63?king:queen}, including feasts with something fit to eat for a change! I can also recommend an excellent torturer to help persuade the recalcitrant that you are the best ruler for Pendor.
str_npc_rayne_kingsupport_2|As you know, Gregory brought down Fire and Sword upon the Knights of the Falcon, but some still remain in hiding or exile. Should you restore our Order and call them from hiding, you would find strong support in Ravenstern, too, since our Knights were all of noble birth. There is many a Ravenstern family that would like to welcome home an exiled younger son or brother.
str_npc_julia_kingsupport_2|Certainly, Centurion. You know how Marius judged me guilty of murder and never gave me the chance to tell my side of the story. If you made it known that all men would receive a fair hearing before being arbitrarily sentenced to death by some lord, we common folk would love you for it.
str_npc_frederick_kingsupport_2|While you lack maturity, Captain, you are wise for your years and have ever shown an even hand in dealing with our troop. I see no reason why you could not govern a land as well.
str_npc_ediz_kingsupport_2|Of course, captain. You have shown respect for the traditions of individual members of our troop. Do the same for all in Pendor, and you will be a popular {reg63?king:queen}, and would perhaps even gain respect from the Singalians.
str_npc_sara_kingsupport_2|Assuredly, O Valorous One. I shall see to it that ballads of your bravery and poems praising your goodness, generosity and mercy circulate in every tavern in the land.
str_npc_donavan_kingsupport_2|I would indeed, Captain. You just unite this land, and then I'll raise you army such as Pendor has never seen, augmented by those Barclay dragoons I once mentioned to you.
str_npc_diev_kingsupport_2|I surely would. The lords will cavil that you've no blue blood, but they bleed as red as you from a sword cut and the common folk will be pleased with you.
str_npc_alyssa_kingsupport_2|Yess, indeed, I begin to warm to your planss to rule. It would please me if you ordered the peasantss to cultivate more vegetables, however, and sshowed some mercy to those who follow my goddess.
str_npc_roland_kingsupport_2|With Astraea's guidance I shall be your strong right arm, my {reg63?lord:lady} so long as you are just and merciful to the people of Pendor. If rule corrupts you, I shall confront you with your sins, however, and punish you in Astraea's name!
str_npc_kaverra_kingsupport_2|Sure enough, Captain. You make it so a woman can travel this land without fearing rape, kidnap or worse, and send those Vanskerries packing, back to that frozen hell of a land they come from, and I'll lay down my life in your cause if you need me to!
str_npc_sigismund_kingsupport_2|Right then, Captain. I'll drink to that! You make life safe for village craftsmen and farmers, and I'll be your sworn man all my days.
str_npc_boadice_kingsupport_2|Then, {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, I shall begin training troops on my fief, towards your and my own greater honor, against the day I leave to take back my throne!
str_npc_adonja_kingsupport_2a|Interesting - I wonder if the Mystmountain Raiders would cooperate.
str_npc_leslie_kingsupport_2a|What you suggest is most sensible and perfectly feasible.
str_npc_ansen_kingsupport_2a|Please tell me more. Your knowledge is invaluable.
str_npc_riva_kingsupport_2a|Of course - let me tell you of my noble Pendoran lineage.
str_npc_kassim_kingsupport_2a|I might overlook small quarrels or raids, and could restore your D'Shar rights.
str_npc_lethaldiran_kingsupport_2a|I think it is high time the Noldor were considered Pendor citizens like any others.
str_npc_jocelyn_kingsupport_2a|I will enforce order ruthlessly, but temper justice with mercy...
str_npc_alistair_kingsupport_2a|Hmmm, I suppose every court needs someone to act as a social arbiter.
str_npc_rayne_kingsupport_2a|Gregory violated Pendor law with that ban, and your Order will be restored.
str_npc_julia_kingsupport_2a|Of course I would give my subjects those rights.
str_npc_frederick_kingsupport_2a|Even-handedness is crucial to any monarch, and I will never forget that.
str_npc_ediz_kingsupport_2a|A fair ruler must be a brave one, but harsh to those who break the laws.
str_npc_sara_kingsupport_2a|That would be very helpful. I thank you, my Court Bard to be.
str_npc_donavan_kingsupport_2a|That would be amazing - Pendor would be invincible!
str_npc_diev_kingsupport_2a|I had faith in you and you proved me right...
str_npc_alyssa_kingsupport_2a|I will allow freedom of religion, subject to Pendor laws. Sacrifice, however, must end.
str_npc_roland_kingsupport_2a|I will always want you at my right hand to advise me; you are my moral compass.
str_npc_kaverra_kingsupport_2a|You know I would do that...
str_npc_sigismund_kingsupport_2a|Keeping the peasants safe is little enough to ask and I promise to do so.
str_npc_boadice_kingsupport_2a|I will lend you what aid I can when you fight for your throne.
str_npc_adonja_kingsupport_2b|I have fought and killed a lot of your clanspeople...
str_npc_leslie_kingsupport_2b|What's the point in seeking support from greedy merchants, unless there's profit in it?
str_npc_ansen_kingsupport_2b|I cannot pledge to follow only archaic ways.
str_npc_riva_kingsupport_2b|Hmph, that obsession again. I've no interest in pretentiousness of that sort.
str_npc_kassim_kingsupport_2b|I wish to be {reg63?king:queen}, not adjudicate tribal blood feuds and encourage trespass or raids.
str_npc_lethaldiran_kingsupport_2b|I may not be able to live up to your expectations for the Noldor.
str_npc_jocelyn_kingsupport_2b|You ask rather more than I can likely deliver.
str_npc_alistair_kingsupport_2b|That's a rather presumptuous condition.
str_npc_rayne_kingsupport_2b|I'm not sure that restoring your Order would be quite that easy.
str_npc_julia_kingsupport_2b|I'll need some time to consider your words.
str_npc_frederick_kingsupport_2b|Mettenheim ways are not the ways of Pendor.
str_npc_ediz_kingsupport_2b|I will not permit slavers to continue their trade in Singal!
str_npc_sara_kingsupport_2b|I do believe my modesty would be offended by that.
str_npc_donavan_kingsupport_2b|I've no wish to impose sadistic military discipline or import troops.
str_npc_diev_kingsupport_2b|I'd be {reg63?king:queen} of the alley scaff and raff, at best, I fear. Enough of such talk.
str_npc_alyssa_kingsupport_2b|I cannot allow the Snake Cult to kidnap girl babies or practice human sacrifice.
str_npc_roland_kingsupport_2b|I think your standards are too high for me to live up to...
str_npc_kaverra_kingsupport_2b|I don't think your wish is possible - there will always be dangers in Pendor.
str_npc_sigismund_kingsupport_2b|I cannot offend the lords by favoring peasants at the lords' expense...
str_npc_boadice_kingsupport_2b|I cannot, however, pledge to allow your countrywomen to capture men here.
str_npc_adonja_kingsupport_3|I know a few merchants and traders who don't disdain doing a little business with the Mystmountain Clans. I could talk to them, maybe sound them out on supporting you. If I told them you'd end the raids, they'd likely comply with your aims.
str_npc_leslie_kingsupport_3|If you like, I might visit the guildhalls and inns where I have trading contacts, and tell them about your plans to expand the Pendor economic system and improve trade. If I told them you'd lower tariffs and taxes, they would go along! What do you say to that, captain?
str_npc_ansen_kingsupport_3|If you pledged to respect the old traditions of Pendor, my {reg63?lord:lady}, many of the merchants would accept your rule. If you restore the old Pendorian system, then arguably you are a more legitimate {reg63?king:queen} than any of these come-lately usurpers. Give me leave for several weeks, and I will inform the merchant houses of your intention to restore their ancient rights.
str_npc_riva_kingsupport_3|Ah, yes, an ancient and honorable line, indeed. If you give me leave, 'Majesty', I shall visit the villages and castles of this realm and make known the details of your royal ancestry. Of course, I trust you will remember my service to you, when you begin to distribute lands...
str_npc_kassim_kingsupport_3|{reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}, we D'Shar live by honor and herding our flocks. Grant me a few weeks to tell my kin that you support the restoration of our ancient rights, and will not be overly harsh should we lapse on occasion into tribal feuds. When our tribes speak of you as Bahadur, you will be halfway into the khan's tent!
str_npc_lethaldiran_kingsupport_3|Though I am exiled from my people, I yet speak with old friends amongst them. If I tell them that as {reg63?king:queen}, you will end persecution of the Noldor, some will be persuaded. I may, ahem, remove a few of the more strident objectors.
str_npc_jocelyn_kingsupport_3|I've friends yet in Eventide, as well as other Orders. I'll see what support for you I can raise amongst Pendor's knightly Orders.
str_npc_alistair_kingsupport_3|I'm sure a few of my old cohorts will lend me an ear and some support for your cause. Shall I see what I can do for you?
str_npc_rayne_kingsupport_3|You are wise, {reg63?sir:madam}. A restored Order of the Falcon will prove a strong aid to your conquest and defense of Pendor. I shall inform the nobility of your intentions - I need only a few weeks to get the word out where it will do the most good. Court gossip will do the rest.
str_npc_julia_kingsupport_3|Well then, just give me leave for a few weeks and see how fast I can tell the common folk that you will rule justly and equitably, and that lords and commoners alike will be as be one under your law. When they begin to speak of you as {reg63?king:queen}, they'll begin to think of you as one...
str_npc_frederick_kingsupport_3|Support from Mettenheim would aid your cause, and I am sure that I can convince some of the Mettenheim troops in Pendor to follow you, if I go amongst them for a time.
str_npc_ediz_kingsupport_3|Captain, I have a certain standing amongst my people. I did not mention it before, but my father is a powerful headman. I might persuade him to back your cause.
str_npc_sara_kingsupport_3|Then give me leave for a few weeks, my gallant friend, and I will spin such a tales of you as will inspire the dullest lord! The encomiums I bestow upon your virtues, compassion, generosity, and indignation at the state of Pendor will win their hearts. Ahem, I may need to take a certain amount of poetic license with the details, you understand.
str_npc_donavan_kingsupport_3|Give me leave for a few weeks, {reg63?sir:madam}, and I will let all the worthy men of this land know that you are the one to unite not just Pendor, but all the other Pendorian dominions. For according to my thinking, no one should be {reg63?king:king or queen} here unless they have the capacity to rule the entirety of the realm -- and you alone have demonstrated such a capacity, {reg63?sir:madame}.
str_npc_diev_kingsupport_3|Allow me a couple of weeks leave, Captain. I'll stop and shoot a deer or boar in the lord's preserve on my way to Rane, host a fine dinner in the back alleys, and make sure the word gets out that you are the {reg63?king:queen} who should rule Pendor! I'll drop a few hints in the merchants' ears while I'm at it, too, and that way, word will spread everywhere a Rane caravan can travel.
str_npc_alyssa_kingsupport_3|I do not know if I can guarantee ssuport amongsst the Cult, but I will try to convince ssome of my friends if I may take ssome leave.
str_npc_roland_kingsupport_3|Though I hail from Barclay, I know a number of the knights and lords of Pendor. It would take me a few weeks to contact them all, but I feel sure that with Astraea's guidance, I can persuade them to join our cause.
str_npc_kaverra_kingsupport_3|Say, Captain, I might be able to give you some help with the fishing villages and the merchants. My old master is well-respected and he has a lot of friends, and of course, I know all the villagers in Jayek. Could you do without me for few weeks? I could maybe drum up some support for you.
str_npc_sigismund_kingsupport_3|You might remember, Captain, that I got around a lot when I had my militia, and the farmers in the Fierdsvain regarded us right highly. If I took a few weeks to visit the villages I used to protect, I know that when the farmers heard your plans, they'd back you!
str_npc_boadice_kingsupport_3|Grant me some time with the Daughters of Persinoe, and I will see what support I can raise for you.
str_npc_adonja_kingsupport_objection|Chief, you actually sent that drunken sot, Sigismund, off to raise support for your cause amongst farmers?! He will raise nothing but another pint, if left to his own devices. Next time we ride through a village he's visited, we'll be lucky if they don't come after us with torches and pitchforks!
str_npc_leslie_kingsupport_objection|{reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, I think it was a mistake to allow a sadistic martinet like Donavan to speak for you. Half Pendor knows of his ways of training, I'd wager, and you don't want people thinking you are like him!
str_npc_ansen_kingsupport_objection|My {reg63?lord:lady} you have made a serious error in sending Boadice on any sort of mission which requires diplomacy! What person of sense will listen to a haughty ex-queen who despises men? She will harm, not aid, your cause.
str_npc_riva_kingsupport_objection|Captain, I could scarce believe my ears when I heard you had sent that murdering bitch Julia off to muster support for you in the Empire. She'll be lucky if the Legionnaires don't hang her from the gates of Janos. Certainly, no one will pay her any mind when she praises you!
str_npc_kassim_kingsupport_objection|{reg63?Bahadur:Bibi} {playername}, I overheard what you told Kaverra. Do you really think an ignorant peasant wench with a reputation for gelding her enemies is a suitable envoy for such an important mission? Amongst my people, she would be killed instantly.
str_npc_lethaldiran_kingsupport_objection|Captain, I hear you've packed Ediz off to muster support for you amongst his people. Why do you even want Singalian support? They are naught but worthless slavers and mercenaries.
str_npc_jocelyn_kingsupport_objection|Captain, you actually asked Diev, of all people, to aid you in gaining Ravenstern support? What possible mind will any law-abiding people pay to a cowardly poacher? You will harm your cause, not aid it, by sending such an envoy.
str_npc_alistair_kingsupport_objection|Captain, I can only surmise that you have taken leave of your senses. No knight cares to be preached at by a moralizing moron as to the rightness of a rebel to rule. Sir Roland may possibly bore a few knights into token agreement, if you are lucky, assuming he gets past preaching first of Astrea and then remembering to mention your name as a possible ruler.
str_npc_rayne_kingsupport_objection|Captain, to allow a doddering braggart from an enemy country the freedom to plot with his cohorts against Pendor is madness. You will rue the day you let that Mettenwiener speak for you, I'll warrant.
str_npc_julia_kingsupport_objection|Centurion, you cannot have really believed that a jumped-up bandit's whore like Riva could sway the opinions of Larian nobility on your behalf. The first moment she gulps her wine and wipes her lips on her sleeve, or worse, blows her nose on it, they will know her for the parvenu she is! If you wished support amongst the bandits, she might have done some good... 
str_npc_frederick_kingsupport_objection|So, you sent that pretentious young ass, Sir Rayne, off to preach your virtues as potential {reg63?king:queen} of Pendor, did you? Hmmph, you are a bit naive, aren't you? Not, mind you, that I miss the sound of his voice in the troop.
str_npc_ediz_kingsupport_objection|Send an assassin on an errand and you assassinate your cause, Captain, which is exactly what you've done. He'll no doubt adroitly arrange things so it seems you have Noldor support, until he's ready to spring his real plan on you!
str_npc_sara_kingsupport_objection|O Valiant One, you have made a grave mistake today. Who on earth would pay attention to anything a Serpent Priestess has to say? She's likely setting you up for sacrifice, not the throne.
str_npc_donavan_kingsupport_objection|Captain, your tactical instincts are normally excellent, but sending that whining apology for a merchant and soldier to speak to her fellow money grubbers is idiotic. You gain nothing when you deploy an unworthy representative to plead your cause.
str_npc_diev_kingsupport_objection|Could you not have found a more suitable messenger than a runaway from an evil Order? Why would you wish support from his cohorts?
str_npc_alyssa_kingsupport_objection|Ssending a sslut like Ssara to sspread word of your valor and fitness to rule is inssane! She'll sspread nothing but her legss, and perhapss whisspher a word in your favor in the ear of ssome poor ssod of a lordling when she's exhausted his passion.
str_npc_roland_kingsupport_objection|My good {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, I am utterly appalled that you would employ a sinful and murderous dilettante like Sir Alistair as your ambassador. That will count heavily against you, I fear!
str_npc_kaverra_kingsupport_objection|I gotta tell you, Captain, sending that tribal pig Kassim to win support for your cause amongst his heathen kin is a big mistake. You know how they are - they will play every possible side against the middle and likely betray everybody they make a deal with! What do you want with D'Shar support anyhow? They'll never accept you as their Bahadur Khan!
str_npc_sigismund_kingsupport_objection|What the devil were you thinking when you asked that Mystmountain savage to act on your behalf? When she's done talking to those merchants, she'll knife them in the back and steal their goods - and won't that reflect well on you? I never before took you for a fool, Captain, and I hope the problem is that you were drunk when you sent her! That I could understand.
str_npc_boadice_kingsupport_objection|Captain, allowing that bookish young sprig, Ansen, to speak for you is like sending your horse to negotiate with a pack of wolves. He knows nothing he cannot read from a book. You should have sent someone wise in the ways of ruling a country, not a bookworm who fancies himself a medic.
str_npc_adonja_intel_mission|I have some contacts amongst those Ravenstern merchants who don't turn up their noses and refuse to deal with the Mystmountain clans. They hear everything that's going on in their travels. I could visit a couple of them and sniff out the latest gossip for you if you like.
str_npc_leslie_intel_mission|{reg63?Sir:My lady}, if you're interested in the way the political winds are blowing, I could put out a few feelers amongst my merchant acquaintances in {s17}. They have to know every detail of Pendor politics so they know where to invest, buy and sell.
str_npc_ansen_intel_mission|My {reg63?lord:lady}, though my father refuses all contact with me, my sister and I stay in touch. She will have overheard all that is going on, as her husband is the son of another great merchanting house. I know she'd be pleased to see me and she could tell me all about the current talk amongst the great merchant houses.
str_npc_riva_intel_mission|Captain, if you could spare me for a few days, I would like to look up an old comrade-in-arms in Laria, who has from time to time led a small company in the pay of the {s18}. He is a good man, the kind who speaks little and listens much. I'm sure, over a drink or two, he would let me know which way the political winds are blowing in those parts.
str_npc_kassim_intel_mission|If you like, {reg63?Bahadur:Bibi} {playername}, I can take a few days to visit my mother's sister's brother-in-law's family in {s17}. They own a caravanserai there, and hear the news in the {s18}. They may have some gossip about the feuds and rivalries of the D'Shar lords and clans, if that is of interest to you.
str_npc_lethaldiran_intel_mission|Oi, Captain, while I am not strictly welcome in the Woods of Laria, I might be able to contact some former duelling partners of mine and pick up a bit of information as to how the Noldor feel about you.
str_npc_jocelyn_intel_mission|Captain, when I escaped the Order of Eventide, I swore I'd never speak to any of my former Knightly brothers save at the end of a sword's point. Because of my respect for you, I'd be willing to contact a few of them on your behalf, and try to sway them to your cause. I cannot guarantee that they will listen, however.
str_npc_alistair_intel_mission|Support from the {s18} could only improve your chances of ruling Pendor, Captain, and as you know, my family stands high in {s17}. I might see if any of my old friends might be inclined to pass on a little {s17} gossip.
str_npc_rayne_intel_mission|{reg63?Sir:My lady}, it has been some time since I enjoyed the civilities of {s17}, and the company of the hidden Knights of the Falcon. I could perhaps go there, and furnish you with an account of what is currently occupying the lord of {s17}.
str_npc_julia_intel_mission|Centurion, I've been thinking a few of my old mates from the {s17} tavern I worked in might be glad to see me. They would never betray the city, but like me, they have no particular affection for blue-bloods or Snake worshipers, and may be willing to slip a little political gossip our way. The gentry are always falling out over one little thing or another, you know.
str_npc_frederick_intel_mission|I hear that some of the Mettenheim troops are currently in the vicinity of {s17}. It would be good to hear some gossip of their exploits in Pendor; such information might benefit you as well.
str_npc_ediz_intel_mission|Captain, I hear some of my cousins have hired on with the lord of {s17}. If I went there to see them, I might pick up some useful information for you about what their lord is thinking and doing.
str_npc_sara_intel_mission|Oh valiant one! With your permission, I was thinking that I might pay a visit to Savador Castle. I try not to revisit old haunts very often, but I have delightful memories of a knight who serves the lord there, and I may be able to provide you some information about his lord's political leanings.
str_npc_donavan_intel_mission|Captain, you'll recall I helped train the garrison of {s17}? One of their number has lately been in touch with me, and suggests that if I were to visit him, he could pass me information on events within the {s18}. I am willing to do this, if you can spare me. While it is a great disgrace to be a traitor, there is no dishonor in making use of one.
str_npc_diev_intel_mission|Say, Captain, my adopted parents aren't getting any younger, and I'd like to pay them a visit. My father doubtless has heard a great deal of gossip in his travels as a caravn master, and I could likely glean some good information for you there.
str_npc_alyssa_intel_mission|I sstill have ssome good friends in {s17}, Captain, who do not hold it against me that I left the Snake Cult. Sshall I go there and ssee what I might learn of {s17} for you?
str_npc_roland_intel_mission|My good Captain, I've received a letter from a friend of mine who is also a Knight of the Dawn. It appears that our Barclay Order has sent a contingent of them to Pendor to aid Pendor's fight against the Snake Cult. They have just landed in {s17}. I would very much like to hear news of my former Order, and I'm sure that information would interest you as well.
str_npc_kaverra_intel_mission|Captain, I've had word my granfer's failing and wants to see me. I'd like to go and see him off, if you'd permit. While I'm in Jayek I can see what the fisherfolk have to say, and also stop in to see my old master in {s17}. He likely can provide some good gossip.
str_npc_sigismund_intel_mission|Captain, I've a mind to visit my old village and sink a few pints with the lads there, just get a sort of feeling for what's going on in the {s18} these days, how many raids they've had, and I'd like to see how Claire's little sister grew up. If I could take a few days leave, I'm sure I'd learn something there of benefit to us.
str_npc_boadice_intel_mission|Captain, I've a wish to spend a few days on leave in {s17}. There's a, well, you see, there's a girl there... I can't seem to get her out of my mind, and I'd like to see her again. Her father's a wealthy landowner and I could probably pick up a bit of gossip for you while I was there.
str_npc_adonja_fief_acceptance|You will make me the lady of {s17}? Oh, Captain, I can send for my clan and they can settle in a safe place at last and never have to raid again!
str_npc_leslie_fief_acceptance|{s17} as a fief? Well, I've always run a business, not governed anything. I'd wager I could make that place yield a fair bit of revenue. I thank you, {reg63?my Lord:my lady}, you are most kind to me.
str_npc_ansen_fief_acceptance|{reg63?My lord:My lady}, it is most generous of you to offer me {s17}. I would be pleased to hold it, and I swear to govern it kindly and justly.
str_npc_riva_fief_acceptance|It is good of you to grant me {s17} as a fief and quite fitting. You will ever command the loyalty of my ancient house and always be my welcome guest.
str_npc_kassim_fief_acceptance|{reg63?Bahadur:Bibi}, I would be most pleased to hold {s17}. I will send word to to my kinsmen, and let them know that there is honorable gold to be earned serving under me in your armies. They will flock to fight under your banner!
str_npc_lethaldiran_fief_acceptance|{reg63?Sir:Lady}, I thank you for the offer of a fief. I think I'll start a school for rangers there, and train you up a Noldor force for your protection.
str_npc_jocelyn_fief_acceptance|Aye, I'll hold {s17}, with thanks and loyalty to you. I swear to keep it free of Heretics and anyone else who breaks your laws. I'll also take on some new squires and begin training up some more knights for you.
str_npc_alistair_fief_acceptance|You recompense me with the fief of {s17}? Thank you, Captain, I am in your debt and will serve you loyally for all my days.
str_npc_rayne_fief_acceptance|{reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, I wish my father were still alive to see this day. {s17} as my own holding? I hardly know what to say, other than to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
str_npc_julia_fief_acceptance|You'd make me a lady, Centurion? No thanks, I'll have none of that, but if you'd title me 'Tribune'- a tribune was a servant of the people in the Old Empire - then I suppose I could bring myself to run {s17} for you. Blue-blooded malefactors and stray Snake Cultists will rue the day I take up my office there!
str_npc_frederick_fief_acceptance|You grant a citizen of Mettenheim a Pendor fief? I am honored to accept. You shall see how well I hold it for you.
str_npc_ediz_fief_acceptance|Well, Captain, I suppose I could settle down in {s17} and keep order there for you. I'll see if some of my clan would like to settle there with me!
str_npc_sara_fief_acceptance|How generous and kind you are, O Valorous One. Allow me to express my joy at your bestowal of this signal honor upon me. Your perspicacity and judgement rival that of King Solomon, whose wisdom was hitherto unsurpassed. Ooh, this means I can have my very own stable of knights, too! I must begin, um, recruiting at once!
str_npc_donavan_fief_acceptance|You do me a great honor, captain. In Barclay, a younger son has few opportunities to earn a fief of his own. Here, in Pendor, there is still the chance for a man to win with his sword what was denied him by his birth! I shall hold {s17} as your vassal, and raise an army to fight for your glory and my own honor.
str_npc_diev_fief_acceptance|Well, {reg63?sir:my lady}, that's gracious of you, and shows what a right one you are! A lot of the noble lords around here will think a man like me unfit to hold a fief. Those under my protection will enjoy warm houses, low taxes, and enough to eat. Damn, I wonder if hunting will be as much fun when I legally hunt in my own forests... 
str_npc_alyssa_fief_acceptance|Sso, I am to be a lady insstead of a Priestess? I rather like that idea, and I will enjoy my new sstatuss. My thanks, Captain.
str_npc_roland_fief_acceptance|My good {reg63?Sir:Madam} Captain, I do not wish to own a fief as that would go against my vows to Astraea. I could perhaps govern it for you, as your servant and that of Astraea, and endeavor to keep justice ever present there.
str_npc_kaverra_fief_acceptance|By Thallo, me to be a lady, when the best I'd hoped for out of life was to be a merchant! I'll see to it that no Raider ever threatens my people, that I swear. Just you let me know when you need me to fight for you and I won't be a minute getting there, Captain!
str_npc_sigismund_fief_acceptance|Well that's downright generous of you, Captain. I do believe I'll hire myself a good brewer, buy the best grain in Sarleon, set some hops to growing and in a few years, my ale will be the best in Pendor.
str_npc_boadice_fief_acceptance|Captain, I thank you more than words can express. I never dreamed I'd end a landowner in Pendor when I fled Veccavia. I shall begin recruiting and training troops immediately, against the day I can take back my rightful place.
str_npc_adonja_woman_to_woman|Damn, Chief, you've taught these Pendorian wimps a fine lesson, that you have, and I really enjoyed slitting open their sorry carcasses for loot! In the Mystmountains, we don't tolerate that sort of sexist bullshit - we value people for their ability and accomplishments.
str_npc_leslie_woman_to_woman|So, Madam Captain, you have certainly taught these petty-minded Pendorian dolts what a woman can do, by single-handedly out-doing every man in the land. I'm proud to be part of your company - you are an inspiration to every woman in Pendor!
str_npc_riva_woman_to_woman|Madam, as a lady of refinement, I should deplore your actions in this man's world or ours, but instead find that I can only rejoice at your successes. You have made me rethink what a 'woman's place' can truly be - on top of the world, or the throne of a united Pendor, if she so chooses!
str_npc_julia_woman_to_woman|Hail, Centurion, I applaud your victories! You have never let your sex get in the way of victory - quite the opposite, in fact. You have used it to your advantage against those cretinous lords who try to keep women barefoot, pregnant and subservient to them.
str_npc_ediz_woman_to_woman|You handle yourself well in the face of the discourtesy offered you by these fools of Pendor lords. And here, most of them cannot even write their names, while you both read and write! I faced many of the same difficulties here at first, but amongst the medical profession, it is intelligence and study which earns respect.
str_npc_sara_woman_to_woman|My Valorous Captain, I have made the fact that you are a better warrior and more successful tactician than any man in Pendor a major feature of my poems and ballads about your victories. As you may recall, it was I who saved our party from the Heretics near the lake, not the strutting little lordly cocks on dunghills who ran from the fight! Women like us are exceptional and I am proud to know you.
str_npc_kaverra_woman_to_woman|Hah, Captain, between the two of us, half the men in Pendor will soon be running about gelded like bull calves in spring, as they well deserve! Not that the lords are known for their cojones, anyway, let alone their brain power, mind you.
str_npc_adonja_turn_against|I'm sorry that we meet like this, boss. There's no question that I owe my rise in life to you. You doubtless think me ungrateful. However, one has to follow one's destiny -- isn't that correct?
str_npc_leslie_turn_against|This is a sad day. I never thought that I might meet my old captain on the field of battle. Even if I triumph, it will bring me no joy.
str_npc_ansen_turn_against|Oh {playername} -- what a tragic turn our lives have taken! I can only hope that the tides of war, having made us enemies today, will one day allow us to be friends.
str_npc_riva_turn_against|Aye, well... I'm not sure what to say. If we must fight, let's get it over with.
str_npc_kassim_turn_against|{playername} Bahadur! I took your salt, and was well rewarded for it! However, I will remind you of an old truth -- that while a Singalian may be an ardent follower, and a devoted friend, he will never be your slave... Anyway, today I come against you with my sword raised. But I hope that one day we raise a glass together, to a friendship renewed.
str_npc_lethaldiran_turn_against|It grieves me more than anything I can say to meet you like this, {playername}. I shall not dwell on the circumstances that have led us to this point. I can only hope that we may one day be reconciled.
str_npc_jocelyn_turn_against|Well, captain. You made of me a great lord, and for that I am grateful. However, you did not buy me, and now that the circumstances have caused us our interests to clash, I can meet you in battle with a clear conscience. Still, I hope some day that circumstances may change again, and we may meet as friends.
str_npc_alistair_turn_against|So we now we meet as enemies, and may shortly face each other over the rims of our shields. A grim day this is. Sometimes, the spinners of our fate have a dark sense of humor.
str_npc_rayne_turn_against|I will not accept fault for the circumstances which have led us to become enemies. I want you to know that my conscience is clear, although my heart is heavy.
str_npc_julia_turn_against|Well, it looks like the tides of fate have led me to make war on my old captain. Maybe things started to go wrong when you became my liege -- I suppose I was never much suited to vassalage. Anyway, here we are now. Maybe, when the world is changed and there are no more masters and servants, or lords and vassals, then we can meet together as friends.
str_npc_frederick_turn_against|Great heaven, {reg63?laddie:lassie}. So now it looks like you and I are enemies. Didn't I say that life takes us on some very strange turns? Destiny sometimes has a cruel sense of humor -- I'll say that much.
str_npc_ediz_turn_against|So, it seems we must fight. I would have you know, {reg63?sir:my lady}, that I have not betrayed you. I had never served you as a man, but served the principles which I believed you upheld. As you no longer uphold them, I must do my best to thwart you. But I bear you no ill will, and I hope that we can meet again some day as friends
str_npc_sara_turn_against|It is sad to meet you as my enemy, Captain -- but on the other hand, to meet such a titan of the battlefield as yourself in combat is a rare privilege. Truly, the news of our contest today shall keep the bards and poets of Pendor in wine and silver for months to come, do you think?
str_npc_donavan_turn_against|Well, {playername}. We meet as enemies. I confess that I have mixed feelings. It grieves me to make war on you, but if we meet in battle and I prevail, I will have defeated the worthiest foe in all Pendor, and I will know that my mastery of the military art is complete!
str_npc_diev_turn_against|Ah... I have not been looking forward to this day. I just want to say that in my sight, if you'd kept your faith in me, things would never have come to this. But no doubt you see it differently.
str_npc_alyssa_turn_against|Hello, Captain! So, I guess we're enemies! One small word of warning if we end up fighting each other -- once the rage of battle hits me, I can't always account for my actions. Just know that whatever I do, it's not personal. Maybe if we both walk away from this, we can meet once more as friends?
str_npc_roland_turn_against|Hello, Captain! So, I guess we're enemies! One small word of warning if we end up fighting each other -- once the rage of battle hits me, I can't always account for my actions. Just know that whatever I do, it's not personal. Maybe if we both walk away from this, we can meet once more as friends?
str_npc_kaverra_turn_against|Hello, Captain! So, I guess we're enemies! One small word of warning if we end up fighting each other -- once the rage of battle hits me, I can't always account for my actions. Just know that whatever I do, it's not personal. Maybe if we both walk away from this, we can meet once more as friends?
str_npc_sigismund_turn_against|Hello, Captain! So, I guess we're enemies! One small word of warning if we end up fighting each other -- once the rage of battle hits me, I can't always account for my actions. Just know that whatever I do, it's not personal.

str_npc_boadice_turn_against|Hello, Captain! So, I guess we're enemies!

str_companion_strings_end|INVALID
str_npc_siggy_to_adonja_1_a|Don't sidle up to me, you Raider wench! You will likely betray us to your Mystmountain cohorts, sure as I like ale!
str_npc_adonja_to_siggy_1_a|You surly, drink-addled clod, cease calling me 'Raider Wench!'  You led an amateur farmboy militia - whereas I successfully led many raiding parties.
str_npc_siggy_to_adonja_2_a|I know you're just waiting to pick over all our corpses.
str_npc_adonja_to_siggy_2_a|Unlike you, Commander Siggydumb, I led my raids sober, not slobbering drunk. Now piss off, you ale-sodden wanker, or I'll slit your throat!
str_npc_donavan_to_leslie_1_a|Leslie, you will obey my commands in battle or suffer a flogging! I'll bare your back just as quickly as any man's for that flogging, too!
str_npc_leslie_to_donavan_1_a|You are a sadistic little troll.
str_npc_donavan_to_leslie_2_a|Offer me any more impudence when I give you an order, and you'll regret it.
str_npc_leslie_to_donavan_2_a|Why don't you go pull the wings off a fly, drop a frog into boiling water, torture a puppy or whatever else you do for fun?
str_npc_ansen_to_boadice_1_a|That cut of yours may well become infected without attention, and I am the medic for this troop and under orders from the captain to treat the wounded.
str_npc_boadice_to_ansen_1_a|I tell you one final time without drawing my blade that women of my rank are not attended medically by men.
str_npc_ansen_to_boadice_2_a|Madam, please cooperate with me.
str_npc_boadice_to_ansen_2_a|Do not approach me again!
str_npc_riva_to_julia_1_a|Julia, you will accord me the respect due my rank, or we shall come to blows.
str_npc_julia_to_riva_1_a|So I am now to accord respect to a jumped up bandit's whore pretending she's a lady, am I? I think not.
str_npc_riva_to_julia_2_a|I will no longer tolerate your impertinent comments to me concerning my family and my status as a lady.
str_npc_julia_to_riva_2_a|We of the Empire can easily recognize low-class trash when it intrudes upon us.
str_npc_kassim_to_kaverra_1_a|You are no more than an uppity peasant girl who takes pride in an action which would earn you death amongst my people.
str_npc_kaverra_to_kassim_1_a|Kassim, you're naught but a caravan-raiding tribal savage.
str_npc_kassim_to_kaverra_2_a|Raiding is a way of life for us.
str_npc_kaverra_to_kassim_2_a|I'll have your balls for earrings if you keep blathering on about a woman's place.
str_npc_kassim_to_kaverra_3_a|Beating women who talk too much and disrespectfully is also one of our customs.
str_npc_kaverra_to_kassim_3_a|You'll go back to your tribe singing soprano!
str_npc_ediz_to_lethaldiran_1_a|One who hides in shadows and kills in disguise is lower than a dung beetle's belly.
str_npc_lethaldiran_to_ediz_1_a|You Singalians have an interesting attitude, all right.
str_npc_ediz_to_lethaldiran_2_a|I challenge you to fight me and prove you have some true manhood.
str_npc_lethaldiran_to_ediz_2_a|Why not avoid a direct battle and strike later from behind, when your enemy is off guard?
str_npc_ediz_to_lethaldiran_3_a|Let's see if you can fight like a man, not a viper under a rock!
str_npc_lethaldiran_to_ediz_3_a|Who cares what method you use to kill, if you come out ahead of the game in the end?
str_npc_jocelyn_to_diev_1_a|I cannot understand why our Captain saw fit to enlarge our ranks with alley scum and poachers who ran from battle.
str_npc_diev_to_jocelyn_1_a|So, you don't approve of poachers who share food with the hungry? What did you do for charity before you ran away from your Order like any coward?
str_npc_jocelyn_to_diev_2_a|I don't like you, Diev, and I advise you to avoid my company.
str_npc_diev_to_jocelyn_2_a|I don't give a damn what you think of me.
str_npc_alistair_to_roland_1_a|I quite understand why you abandoned those Twits of the Dawn, Roland, but why must you persist in following their tenets so doggedly?
str_npc_roland_to_alistair_1_a|I left the Order of the Dawn, Alistair, but I have never forsaken Astraea, nor will I.
str_npc_alistair_to_roland_2_a|After all, those bonfire-addicted cretins will assuredly set you ablaze the instant they lay hands on you.
str_npc_roland_to_alistair_2_a|I do not fear death. I have lived a good and virtuous life, and if the gods are just, they will welcome me based on this life I have lived. Can you say the same? Have you lived so noble a life that memories of you will live on in the hearts of those who love you, once you are gone?
str_npc_alistair_to_roland_3_a|Your devotion to Astraea is misplaced and will most certainly lead to your death at the stake.
str_npc_rayne_to_fred_1_a|Hah, Frederick, no wonder you call your regiment 'Forlorn Hope.' I can picture a quite forlorn lot of geezers, leaning upon their swords for support, as they lurch into battle.
str_npc_fred_to_rayne_1_a|Sir Rayne, I will have you know that men of my age and experience invariably best younger, brasher knights in combat than you will ever be!
str_npc_rayne_to_fred_2_a|Go and nurse your arthritis by the fire; your tales of Mettenheim's valor do not interest me.
str_npc_fred_to_rayne_2_a|Would you care for a demonstration? If so, I am going to hack you to pieces!
str_npc_alyssa_to_sara_1_a|SSara, your preoccupation with sseducing men is disruptive to troop disscipline.
str_npc_sara_to_alyssa_1_a|So I am now to take advice on deportment from a Snake Cult Priestess? I think not!
str_npc_alyssa_to_sara_2_a|Should one of our priesstesses conduct herself thussly amongst our knights, sshe would find hersself ssacrificed to Azi Dahaka possthaste.
str_npc_sara_to_alyssa_2_a|How you conduct yourself amongst your murderous cult is of no interest to me whatsoever.
str_npc_diev_to_adonja_1_b|Adonja, I've watched you toady to our bookish medic. Are you softening him up to get information about his father's caravans for future raids?
str_npc_adonja_to_diev_1_b|By the rending claws of Vejovis, Diev, I am polite to Ansen because he offers courtesy to me, unlike some I might name!
str_npc_diev_to_adonja_2_b|Nothing but scum comes out of the Mystmountains and they run like cowards from Ravenstern troops.
str_npc_adonja_to_diev_2_b|We of the Mystmountains are accustomed to prejudice, but I'll not tolerate it from one who ran from battle. Drummed out of the guard for it, weren't you? Be careful who you name coward, lest the name stick to you!
str_npc_leslie_to_kassim_b|You know, Kassim, in Barclay, we'd say that someone with your attitude has 'navel vison.' Your head is stuck so far up your arse, you have to peer out through your navel to see anything. Now bugger off and go annoy someone else. I'm done with listening to your sexist idiocies.
str_npc_kassim_to_leslie_b|When you find yourself a concubine amongst the tents of my people, you will learn that an attitude such as yours brings death, if you are lucky; if not, removal of your tongue and a sound beating!
str_npc_fred_to_ansen_1_b|You should have abandoned your hopes long since, young Ansen, as you will never make a knight.
str_npc_ansen_to_fred_1_b|Sir Frederick, I realize that you have vastly more experience than I in warfare, but I wish to learn and your sarcastic comments do not aid me.
str_npc_fred_to_ansen_2_b|Resign yourself to being a medic and curing the wounded and quit trying for knighthood before you are killed.
str_npc_ansen_to_fred_2_b|If you wish my fighting techniques to improve, teach me! That, at least, would be constructive.
str_npc_lethaldiran_to_riva_1_b|Your kind plagued the Woods of Laria for years, you bandit slut.
str_npc_riva_to_lethaldiran_1_b|You Noldor scum, how dare you address me so informally?
str_npc_lethaldiran_to_riva_2_b|You get from me precisely the respect and honor you merit.
str_npc_riva_to_lethaldiran_2_b|You will call me Lady Riva, Lethaldiran, and ask my permission to approach me in future. If you do not, I shall make you regret your impudence.
str_npc_lethaldiran_to_riva_3_b|Pretending to be of noble birth does not make you so. Your airs and graces are ludicrous.
str_npc_jocelyn_to_alistair_1_b|Even when we trained together as youths, Alistair, I detested you. You were a smarmy little mawworm then and you have not improved with maturity.
str_npc_alistair_to_jocelyn_1_b|I fail to see why you so stubbornly refuse to return to our ranks in the Order of Eventide. You must know, Jocelyn, that this refusal is your death sentence, which is slated to be carried out in a most unpleasant way.  As you doubtless recall from our days of training together, I can almost certainly best you in a trial of arms. Do be sensible and return to the fold.
str_npc_jocelyn_to_alistair_2_b|Attempt to kill me and we'll see how your dishonorable fighting techniques succeed. I shall kill you where you stand.
str_npc_boadice_to_rayne_1_b|Tell me, Sir Rayne, do the Knights of the Falcon habitually recruit from amongst the ranks of stiff-necked cretins, or is becoming simply a part of your traditional training?
str_npc_rayne_to_boadice_1_b|I am not, madam, a 'stiff-necked cretin,' and I'll thank you to keep such comments to yourself. A knight's dignity and honor are as important as his fighting skills, and the Knights of the Falcon excel in all.
str_npc_boadice_to_rayne_2_b|Your pompous reaction utterly illustrates my point!
str_npc_rayne_to_boadice_2_b|As a woman, I am sure you are incapable of understanding knightly ways, so I will waste no more words upon you.
str_npc_julia_to_sara_1_b|Your constant flirting, you slut, is why I hold you in contempt. How can you lower yourself to flirt with every man you meet?
str_npc_sara_to_julia_1_b|And what does a tavern bouncer know of a lady's behavior? I do not flirt, as you so crudely put it; I merely enliven this company with my wit, humor and words!
str_npc_julia_to_sara_2_b|Try for a little dignity and decorum, won't you?
str_npc_ediz_to_kaverra_1_b|Women do not belong on the field of battle.
str_npc_kaverra_to_ediz_1_b|Don't you go telling me what a woman can and cannot do on a battlefield.
str_npc_ediz_to_kaverra_2_b|Just because you wield a ludicrous weapon with an even more ridiculous name does not make you a warrior in my eyes.
str_npc_kaverra_to_ediz_2_b|You bumptious piece of dung.
str_npc_ediz_to_kaverra_3_b|One of our Singalian Temptresses would kill you in the blink of an eye.
str_npc_kaverra_to_ediz_3_b|I can fight as well as any man! I'll demonstrate if you like.
str_npc_siggy_to_donavan_1_b|I've had it with your arbitrary and unauthorized orders, Donavan, you sadistic, petty little martinet.
str_npc_donavan_to_siggy_1_b|Drinking makes you even grumpier than you normally are when sober. Why don't you just shut the hell up?
str_npc_siggy_to_donavan_2_b|Next time you start handing me your guff, I'll hand you something more lethal than an order in return!
str_npc_donavan_to_siggy_2_b|If I want your opinion, I'll ask for it. Don't hold your breath while you wait.
str_npc_alyssa_to_roland_1_b|Do tell me, Ssir Roland, ssince you desserted your Order, why does the sstench of ssanctimony still pervade your vicinity?
str_npc_roland_to_alyssa_1_b|You, Madam Alyssa, are the embodiment of all I loathe. Your very voice makes my skin crawl.
str_npc_alyssa_to_roland_2_b|Ssuch passion for one ssworn to virtue!
str_npc_roland_to_alyssa_2_b|Were it not for our Captain, I'd have killed you long since, for your own sins and those of your cult.
str_npc_alyssa_to_roland_3_b|How uncharitably murderouss you are!
str_npc_roland_to_alyssa_3_b|Approach me not again, or your life is at risk.
str_npc_ansen_to_adonja_c|Adonja, would you tell me of some of the Mystmountain clans' traditions and history? I know nothing about your people and would like to learn of them.
str_npc_adonja_to_ansen_c|I am flattered at your interest in the Mystmountain clans, Ansen, and would be most pleased to tell you of them. We have some interesting battle chants and epic poems.
str_npc_diev_to_leslie_c|I've no mind to see you go, Leslie, but you're not cut out for life in a mercenary company. One of these days, I'd like to take you away with me, maybe start a merchanting company of our own. What say you to that?
str_npc_leslie_to_diev_c|You are kind to think of me, Diev, and I will consider your words, in the event we both survive this endless fighting. I am honored by your offer.
str_npc_kassim_to_riva_c|Ah, Riva Bibi, I would carry you off to my people did I not fear awakening after a night of passion only to find my throat slit! I joy in fighting beside you!
str_npc_riva_to_kassim_c|I thank you, Kassim, and I greatly enjoy battle when you are at my side! We make rather an effective team, I think.
str_npc_julia_to_lethaldiran_c|Based on our last battle, Leth, we've much to learn from you Noldor in terms of battle technique. Thanks for covering my back. Show me that counter-move you used on the fellow trying to take me from behind, would you?
str_npc_lethaldiran_to_julia_c|You, my dear, are as lovely as you are lethal, and you appeal to me on the basis of both. I would be pleased to show you that counterstrike. Is there anything else you'd like me to demonstrate to you, hmm?
str_npc_jocelyn_to_boadice_1_c|Madam, with the exception of your habit of gelding your male slaves, I must say I approve of your island's customs, particularly that of training your women in warrior skills.
str_npc_boadice_to_jocelyn_1_c|I thank you, Sir Jocelyn. Pity you're a man, or you would have made a fine commander.
str_npc_jocelyn_to_boadice_2_c|It is good to see women so highly trained in battle as yourself. Pendor would do well to follow that one, at least, of your customs.
str_npc_boadice_to_jocelyn_2_c|I am unused to accepting praise from those of your sex, but I appreciate your praise of my fighting skills.
str_npc_alistair_to_alyssa_1_c|I am sure that you at least, my dear Alyssa, can appreciate the deplorable lack of decent food in Pendor.  What do your snakeish confreres serve at feasts? Not roasted reptile, one assumes?
str_npc_alyssa_to_alistair_1_c|Roassted reptile?! Certainly not! We prefer organically-grown vegetarian fare in the Sserpent Temple. We never eat meat; the very thought of doing sso is revolting.
str_npc_alistair_to_alyssa_2_c|I fondly recall my father's feasts. He had an exceptionally skilled torturer, who could keep a victim shrieking throughout several dozen courses. From the peacock tongues through the chine of beef, their screams were quite stimulating to the appetite.
str_npc_alyssa_to_alistair_2_c|I find the concept of torture during dinner parties mosst intriguing, I musst ssay.
str_npc_rayne_to_ediz_c|Ediz, I did not realize that your people had such an admirable code of honor, and I am impressed by your determination to recover your own lost honor in battle. That is the way of a true knight.
str_npc_ediz_to_rayne_c|I admire your fighting skills, Sir Rayne, and were you not an outlander, would welcome you into my clan as a brother.
str_npc_donavan_to_fred_c|Frederick, you are a man after my own heart! Obviously, Mettenheim breeds strong, disciplined warriors who understand how to hold the line in battle.
str_npc_fred_to_donavan_c|You, Donavan, have a clear understanding of the disciplines of battle. Were you in Mettenheim, in a few years you might qualify for recruitment into the Forlorn Hope.
str_npc_siggy_to_sara_1_c|Sara, what say we adjourn to my tent for awhile? I'd like a private sample of your bardic skills!
str_npc_sara_to_siggy_1_c|Mmm, my dear Siggy, I had no idea you were so interested in my bardic talents!
str_npc_siggy_to_sara_2_c|Heh, Heh, 'Fox' is the right name for you, my girl!
str_npc_sara_to_siggy_2_c|Let us indeed adjourn to your tent at our first opportunity. I have some special skills which you may enjoy!
str_npc_kaverra_to_roland_1_c|I wonder why my luck turned so bad, just as I was setting up as a merchant. Don't seem fair that I should be caught by the Vanskerries before ever I sold a single bit of my merchandise.
str_npc_roland_to_kaverra_1_c|Kaverra, lass, it is likely that what befell you was a trial sent you by the gods, to test your mettle.
str_npc_kaverra_to_roland_2_c|I still have nightmares about those Vanskerries and what they did.
str_npc_roland_to_kaverra_2_c|Astraea would welcome you, I am sure, as she would welcome any warrior who is brave and true. You have triumphed over your adversity bravely.
str_npc_adonja_to_enemy_d|I look forward to slitting you open in search of hidden treasure.
str_npc_leslie_to_enemy_d|All you fools want is to kill, kill, kill! Where is the point in fighting over a village burnt to the ground with nothing left but ravaged fields and dead peasants?  You should die for your own stupidity.
str_npc_ansen_to_enemy_d|All you fools can think of is death and dismemberment! Does no one in Pendor ever consider compromise or a parley?!
str_npc_riva_to_enemy_d|Retreat now, while you have the chance.
str_npc_kassim_to_enemy_d|Die, you ferengi camel-lovers! My blade hungers to bathe in your blood!
str_npc_lethaldiran_to_enemy_d|Hah, you don't know what trouble you just walked into! This will be fun! Let's have at it!
str_npc_jocelyn_to_enemy_d|Scum of your ilk does not merit an honorable death in battle, but we generously grant you that. Be grateful, maggots, as we slaughter you.
str_npc_alistair_to_enemy_d|Your threats are puerile, and you are simply stalling in a futile attempt to postpone your death. Stop blathering and fight; your verbal saber-rattlings bore me.
str_npc_rayne_to_enemy_d|Hah! We kill better men than you before we stop for breakfast in the morning. I'm hungry; hurry up and let's finish this!
str_npc_julia_to_enemy_d|Start praying, you bastards, and hope your gods are ready to receive you.
str_npc_fred_to_enemy_d|Hah! You will need to put up a better show than that to impress me.
str_npc_ediz_to_enemy_d|The vultures shall feast on your carcasses tonight!
str_npc_sara_to_enemy_d|This incident will make a most amusing ballad. Pity you will never live to hear it!
str_npc_donavan_to_enemy_d|I look forward to cutting you down as you flee.
str_npc_diev_to_enemy_d|Go back to whatever whorehouse you were born in, or we'll send you to hell in a heartbeat!
str_npc_alyssa_to_enemy_d|Yess, let uss kill them all and sshow no mercy! They merit nothing more. Let the bloodletting begin!
str_npc_roland_to_enemy_d|Come forth and be slain by our swords of righteousness. None of you will live to see the morrow!
str_npc_kaverra_to_enemy_d|We're gonna kill every one of you bastids.
str_npc_siggy_to_enemy_d|You worthless bastards best flee while you can. I'm coming after you!
str_npc_boadice_to_enemy_d|When I'm done with you, you'll beg for death!
str_npc_adonja_to_player_e|Ansen has a certain puppyish charm and I think he has a crush on me. I find him rather sweet, even though he's far from a clan ideal. I never thought to fancy a man who could read.
str_npc_leslie_to_player_e|If ever we cease this fighting, Captain, I may stay on in Pendor to trade. Those towns and villages not ravaged by war would make excellent trade routes for the right merchant, who knows where to buy and sell. Diev and I might make good trading partners if events work out in our favor.
str_npc_ansen_to_player_e|I have all the men patched up again, Captain. We'll need to rest for a bit before they are fit to fight again, however. How about camping for an extra day when next we stop?
str_npc_riva_to_player_e|I never thought I'd grow to like a D'Shar, but Kassim is well-born and a noble soul. He is an excellent addition to the troop, Captain.
str_npc_kassim_to_player_e|I am reminded of some lines from Khushal Khan Khattack, a famous D'Shar poet - 'the boy across the river has buttocks like a ripe peach, but alas, I cannot swim.'  It must be all those fresh-faced peasants in the field over there which brought it to mind.
str_npc_lethaldiran_to_player_e|Captain, you know I stand ready to remove any annoyance for you, particularly in our company, if you take my meaning. I know just where I'd like to start.
str_npc_jocelyn_to_player_e|Sir Alistair is evil beyond all hope of redemption. His presence in this company sullies our honor, and I implore you to sack him posthaste. I feel filthy just being in his presence. There is also the matter between us of his having been despatched by his Order to kill me. I have no doubt he will attempt to do so at his first opportunity.
str_npc_alistair_to_player_e|As per the Feudal Times and Reactionary Herald, the Pendor Lords know about as much about fief management as a three-year-old. One of them erected a gallows outside his village gates, to discourage banditry. Thus far, only his villagers have danced upon it, mostly for causing him petty annoyance. I'll grant you that is amusing,  but it is wasteful when carried to excess. If he persists, he'll soon run-out of peasants to oppress.
str_npc_rayne_to_player_e|That Veccavian woman wants a sharp lesson in common courtesy, if you want my opinion. She had the audacity to refer to me in most discourteous terms, and makes fun of my knightly honor behind my back. Were it not against my code to fight a woman, I'd teach her that lesson, I can tell you.
str_npc_julia_to_player_e|I dread the day we fight the Snake Cult and my father turns up in the battle. Should that happen, Captain, I don't want it to be my hand which slays him. I have enough of my kin's blood on my hands as it is.
str_npc_fred_to_player_e|Verdammnis der Holle! Mein General, the lack of military Disziplin in this... this... Gesindel! is appalling! Mein General, you must force them to behave like proper soldiers, because right now, they behave like the Gesindel they are!
str_npc_ediz_to_player_e|If there were more like such as Sir Rayne in this company, I would be pleased. You should exercise more sense in the way you choose to hire, eliminating those with no fighting skills and less honor.
str_npc_sara_to_player_e|Captain, I vow and declare that if any other member of this troop decides to read me a lecture on morality, I shall reach for my blade. I weary of holier-than-thou speeches from those incapable of anything else!
str_npc_donavan_to_player_e|When you said your lot could use a little discipline and training, I thought I could help you. If you don't back up my authority when I give them an order, this troop will remain an undisciplined rabble!
str_npc_diev_to_player_e|Whenever I think our cause is hopeless, Captain, I think about people like Leslie. She and those like her are the ones who need defending, the decent, honest folk who just want to make a living free of fear and tyranny. She gives me hope.
str_npc_alyssa_to_player_e|You are too ssoft-hearted to be a proper commander. Why cater to these worthless peasantss you coddle by doing their bidding? SSack the villagess and take what you need, I ssay!
str_npc_roland_to_player_e|Captain, I know you sometimes despair at the task before you, and wonder if you can succeed. Keep a stout heart. Even in this evil world, good must ultimately triumph over evil. You must never give up the fight.
str_npc_kaverra_to_player_e|Captain, how's about we chase down a few more of those Vanskerry bastards? I don't have my fill of killing them yet. Don't know as I ever will, but I can try!
str_npc_siggy_to_player_e|I can smell the new-turned earth in the fields of that village over there. Can't believe I miss plowing, but there it is: the scent makes me a wee bit homesick.
str_npc_boadice_to_player_e|When I regain the throne of Veccavi, I think I shall have to return to Pendor and impose some sensible order on this unruly society. I cannot believe they allow their men to run about ungelded and actually permit them to assume superior roles. Pendor would function much better if this situation could be corrected.
str_npc_adonja_to_lord_f|He speaks to you politely now, but once you do what he wants, he'll change his tune.
str_npc_leslie_to_lord_f|Captain, remember that the first offer is only that - the opening bid. See what else is on offer before you close any bargains!
str_npc_ansen_to_lord_f|Look at that red nose and potbelly, Captain! This one likes his wine and food far more than battle, I'd guess, and he probably has the gout. Looks like he has head lice, too.
str_npc_riva_to_lord_f|Captain, you should listen to this lord. One of his superior rank should be accorded respect and obedience.
str_npc_kassim_to_lord_f|Captain, this one is nothing and unfit for you, or indeed our troop, to follow.
str_npc_lethaldiran_to_lord_f|Captain, I could have him out of the way in a jiffy, with none the wiser as to how it happened. Just say the word.
str_npc_jocelyn_to_lord_f|This request is quite reasonable and honorable. I urge you to comply with my Lord's wishes.
str_npc_alistair_to_lord_f|I cannot comprehend this fellow's objection to a few dead peasants, unless perhaps their taxes are in arrears or he has exhausted the village's supply of nubile virgins.
str_npc_rayne_to_lord_f|Be ever wary of Lords and their plots and schemes, Captain. Many come to grief through agreeing to follow a lord.
str_npc_julia_to_lord_f|Captain, if we run about at the beck and call of lords, the gods only know what trouble we'll fall into! You'd do better to take them prisoner and make them dance to your own tune!
str_npc_fred_to_lord_f|These Pendor lords appear always to put their own petty aims ahead of the prosperity of their fiefs. I do not understand such stupidity.
str_npc_ediz_to_lord_f|Amongst the Singalians, we have no lords. We killed the last one over a hundred years ago.
str_npc_sara_to_lord_f|I have spent much time in the courts of Pendor. Do try, my Captain, for behavior appropriate to such a court. Discourtesy to a lord is never wise.
str_npc_donavan_to_lord_f|His ambition likely exceeds the capacity of his purse. Demand an advance payment and see what he says. My guess is that he'll bluster but not come up with the gold.
str_npc_diev_to_lord_f|You can always trust a lord to be a lord - be wary!
str_npc_alyssa_to_lord_f|Thiss lord is a fool! I would ignore him if I were you. He iss far too sstupid to take sseriously!
str_npc_roland_to_lord_f|It may be that this man speaks the truth, Captain, though I rather doubt it. Be careful what you promise him.
str_npc_kaverra_to_lord_f|Hmph, if I were you, Captain, I'd pay no mind to this 'un. Lords is nuthin' but liars, that's what my granfer allus said.
str_npc_siggy_to_lord_f|Another lord asking yet another favor. Don't you get tired of catering to their whims? I certainly do.
str_npc_boadice_to_lord_f|These pathetic excuses for Pendor lords are as moronic as they are pretentious. Give this fool short shrift - you have no need of him.
str_comment_cunning_fierds_hall|I hope you come with good intentions. Then we can speak further.
str_comment_cunning_fierds_map|You look hardened by war and if you are hardened, all that fighting can lead to more than just scrapes and petty loot.
str_comment_cunning_sar_hall|You show promise, and under my tutelage you might become more than a thug.
str_comment_cunning_sar_map|You have the look of someone with strong will but of no purpose. I can give you that purpose.
str_comment_cunning_empire_hall|Unlike some of my peers, I am not at all above making use of the odd stranger.
str_comment_cunning_empire_map|A stranger may have hidden motivations, but those motivations just might coincide with my own.
str_comment_cunning_dshar_hall|I welcome you, if you support the cause of the D'Shar.
str_comment_cunning_dshar_map|It may be that your presence here could be of use to me.
str_comment_cunning_rav_hall|This is no fat land for a politician such as meself. The people are simple, the loyalties are written in stone. An outsider such as yourself though, well, you could change the game.
str_comment_cunning_rav_map|They say that a stranger might prove useful in strange times -- let's hear what you've got to say.
str_comment_upstanding_fierds_hall|Dear friend, what a seldom honor to be in your presence.
str_comment_upstanding_fierds_map|What an honor! I know about your many triumphs and consider you my tutor in the art of war.
str_comment_upstanding_sar_hall|My friend, what a joy to have you near. My men were cheering as they saw you heading towards us.
str_comment_upstanding_sar_map|I am honored to bask in the light of your presence.
str_comment_upstanding_empire_hall|While you may aspire to citizenship in the Empire, it is rarely granted to those such as you. I'd advise you go elsewhere.
str_comment_upstanding_empire_map|By the by, here's a friendly bit of advice: should you see the Noldor - run, don't walk!
str_comment_upstanding_dshar_hall|Greetings, stranger. State your business here.
str_comment_upstanding_dshar_map|I shall permit you to travel across my territory in peace, but raid my villages or harm my tribesmen and I shall kill you!
str_comment_upstanding_rav_hall|We meet here to plan the destruction of our enemies. But still, one must pray for their immortal souls.
str_comment_upstanding_rav_map|Well met, friend. Pass in peace and my men will not accost you.
str_comment_martial_fierds_hall|With that arrogance, you just be glad my weapon is sheathed! Now say what you want and leave the area.
str_comment_martial_fierds_map|You may be a skilled warrior, and if I could be sure that only our enemies feared you, I would say Willkommen.
str_comment_martial_sar_hall|The fact that you do not hold a weapon in your hand shows your recklessness -- and how easily I could crush you.
str_comment_martial_sar_map|My scouts informed me you were coming, but I took no precautions, seeing as it is only you.
str_comment_martial_empire_hall|In the Empire, transgressions by strangers are not taken lightly. I'd advise you heed my advice while you're here.
str_comment_martial_empire_map|Hail. Who crosses my lands without my permission?
str_comment_martial_dshar_hall|If it is trouble you seek in D'Shar lands, I think you have found it.
str_comment_martial_dshar_map|We D'Shar do not take lightly encroachments into our territory.
str_comment_martial_rav_hall|Ah, these walls inspire me. I would rather meet an enemy here than a friend!
str_comment_martial_rav_map|State your business quickly or stand aside!
str_comment_sadistic_fierds_hall|I see you have some bruises from battle. If I cared for your well-being, I'd have my surgeon look at you -- but I don't.
str_comment_sadistic_fierds_map|Yes, what is it? Speak fast before I have my men use you for target practice.
str_comment_sadistic_sar_hall|You look weary from your journeys and could use a drink, I suspect. There's a lake near here. You're welcome.
str_comment_sadistic_sar_map|Please, no more challenges today! I squash people like you as easily as flies.
str_comment_sadistic_empire_hall|As long as you're here, why not go and fight the Snake cult? At least then you'd be of some use to the Empire.
str_comment_sadistic_empire_map|If you're here as a spy for those damned D'Shar savages, I shall kill you where you stand.
str_comment_sadistic_dshar_hall|You may have heard that I impale those who rob or raid in my territory. Keep that in mind.
str_comment_sadistic_dshar_map|What, precisely, do you seek here?
str_comment_sadistic_rav_hall|Ah, you missed the hunt this morning. I rode out on my finest steed with my finest dogs. Would you believe it, though? The girl got away!
str_comment_sadistic_rav_map|I suppose you found me by following the trail of burning villages, eh? Well, my men were cold.
str_comment_pitiless_fierds_hall|So, you are the one roaming the countryside like a thug. Can you speak?
str_comment_pitiless_fierds_map|I heard about your last battle and I'm surprised to see you standing without support.
str_comment_pitiless_sar_hall|The stables are over there. And while you're at it, muck out my jakes as well.
str_comment_pitiless_sar_map|My time is precious. When you arise in the morning, I've already eaten a hearty meal and trained my men, so be brief.
str_comment_pitiless_empire_hall|Should you elect to cause trouble in the Empire, our Legionnaires will see to your punishment -- promptly.
str_comment_pitiless_empire_map|You look brave enough now. I wonder how you'll look when the Snake cult and the Noldor have done with you.
str_comment_pitiless_dshar_hall|And who are you, who enters my hall uninvited?
str_comment_pitiless_dshar_map|I trust you have an excellent excuse for your presence here?
str_comment_pitiless_rav_hall|I've grown weary. Even abusing the servants fails to cheer me.
str_comment_pitiless_rav_map|I suppose you've come to beg help like any other refugee?
str_comment_quarrelsome_fierds_hall|I have killed many boars! In comparison, you are weak and cannot run as fast.
str_comment_quarrelsome_fierds_map|They say I kill for fun, but do you hear me laughing?
str_comment_quarrelsome_sar_hall|You are not one to be trusted and I am not one to be tricked. State your errand and begone.
str_comment_quarrelsome_sar_map|Maybe we'll meet in a tournament someday. I do more harm with blunt weapons than you'd care to know.
str_comment_quarrelsome_empire_hall|We of the Empire have a low tolerance for listening to riffraff. State your business and leave.
str_comment_quarrelsome_empire_map|You have my leave to depart the Empire. We don't want your kind polluting our land.
str_comment_quarrelsome_dshar_hall|If you spy here for the Empire, your life will be very short.
str_comment_quarrelsome_dshar_map|Why do you trespass in D'Shar territory?
str_comment_quarrelsome_rav_hall|It reminds me of how far we've slipped towards barbarism, when I see the likes of you addressing a lord.
str_comment_quarrelsome_rav_map|Don't waste my time, peasant! If I felt the need of useless talk, my wife would be beside me.
str_comment_goodnatured_fierds_hall|May Thallo ver Shures follow you and bring beauty and life wherever you go.
str_comment_goodnatured_fierds_map|You look healthy, my friend, and have many teeth left!
str_comment_goodnatured_sar_hall|Welcome, dear ally. What say you?
str_comment_goodnatured_sar_map|I see your health is strong and your eyes have fervor. Speak freely.
str_comment_goodnatured_empire_hall|I'll not go so far as to say your presence here is entirely welcome, but do no harm in my territory and I'll do none to you.
str_comment_goodnatured_empire_map|I've more of a predilection for peace than war, but that does not mean I will tolerate any incursions into my territory.
str_comment_goodnatured_dshar_hall|As a lord of the D'Shar, I bid you welcome.
str_comment_goodnatured_dshar_map|We of the D'Shar treat our guests well -- when they do not bring harm to our people.
str_comment_goodnatured_rav_hall|Conclaves of war are not my usual pastime, I must admit. Ah, I wish we could get more ale in here.
str_comment_goodnatured_rav_map|Well met, the ride here is lonely, eh? Have ye time to stop and share a wee dram?
str_comment_intro_liege_affiliated|I am told that you are pledged to one of the pretenders who disputes my claim to the crown of Pendor - but we may still talk.
str_comment_intro_famous_liege|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps it is time that you sought a liege worthy of your valor.
str_comment_intro_famous_martial|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps we shall test each other's valor in a tournament, or on the battlefield!
str_comment_intro_famous_badtempered|I've heard of you. Well, I'm not one for bandying words, so if you have anything to say, out with it.
str_comment_intro_famous_pitiless|I know your name. It strikes fear in men's hearts. That is good. Perhaps we should speak together, some time.
str_comment_intro_famous_cunning|Ah, yes. At last we meet. You sound like a good {reg63?man:woman} to know. Let us speak together, from time to time.
str_comment_intro_famous_sadistic|I know your name -- and from what I hear, I'll warrant that many a grieving widow knows too. But that is no concern of mine.
str_comment_intro_famous_goodnatured|I've heard of you! It's very good to finally make your acquaintance.
str_comment_intro_famous_upstanding|I know your name. They say you are a most valiant warrior. I can only hope that your honor and mercy matches your valor.
str_comment_intro_noble_liege|I see that you carry a {reg63?nobleman's:noble's} banner, although I do not recognize the device. Know that I am always looking for good {reg63?men:warriors} to fight for me, once they prove themselves to be worthy of my trust.
str_comment_intro_noble_martial|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. No matter -- a brave {reg63?man's:warrior's} home is all the world, or so they say!
str_comment_intro_noble_badtempered|I don't recognize the device on your banner. No doubt another foreigner come to our lands, as if we didn't have so many here already.
str_comment_intro_noble_pitiless|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Another vulture come to grow fat on the leftovers of war, no doubt!
str_comment_intro_noble_cunning|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Still, it is always worthwhile to make the acquaintance of {reg63?men:women} who may one day prove themselves to be great warriors.
str_comment_intro_noble_sadistic|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Perhaps you are the bastard {reg63?son:daughter} of a puffed-up cattle thief? Or perhaps you stole it?
str_comment_intro_noble_goodnatured|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Please forgive my ignorance! It is good to make your acquaintance.
str_comment_intro_noble_upstanding|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. No doubt you have come to Pendor in search of wealth and glory. If this indeed is the case, then I only ask that you show mercy to those poor souls caught in the path of war.
str_comment_intro_common_liege|You may be of common birth, but know that I am always looking for good men to fight for me, if they can prove themselves to be worthy of my trust.
str_comment_intro_common_martial|Perhaps you are not of gentle birth, but even a commoner, be {reg63?he:she} of sufficient valor, may make something of {reg63?himself:herself} some day.
str_comment_intro_common_badtempered|Speak quickly, if you have anything to say, for I have no time to be bandying words with common soldiers of fortune.
str_comment_intro_common_pitiless|You have the look of a mercenary, another vulture come to grow fat on the misery of this land.
str_comment_intro_common_cunning|Well... I have not heard of you, but you have the look of a {reg63?man:woman} who might make something of {reg63?himself:herself}, some day.
str_comment_intro_common_sadistic|Normally I cut the throats of impudent commoners who barge into my presence uninvited, but I am in a good mood today.
str_comment_intro_common_goodnatured|Well, you look like a good enough sort.
str_comment_intro_common_upstanding|Peace to you, and always remember to temper your valor with mercy, your courage with honor.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_liege|I have heard much about you. Some men may fear a woman who is versed in the art of war, but I will not scorn one who can wield a sword, should she be brave and loyal.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_martial|I have heard much about you. They say that you are the equal of even the bravest of men in your prowess at arms. Perhaps one day I shall try my valor against yours, either in a tournament or on the battlefield!
str_comment_intro_female_famous_badtempered|I've heard of talk of you -- the woman who fights like a man - and thinks like one.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_pitiless|I know your name. It strikes fear in men's hearts. That is good. Perhaps we should speak together, some time.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_cunning|Ah, yes. At last we meet. You sound like a good woman to know. Let us speak together, from time to time.

str_comment_intro_female_famous_upstanding|I know your name. They say you are a most valiant warrior. I can only hope that your honor and mercy matches your valor.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_liege|It is not often that I meet a woman who leads men into battle. But these are dark and troubled times, and I will not scorn one who can wield a sword, should she be brave and loyal.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_martial|I do not recognize the device on your banner, but clearly you are a lady of rank. Please consider me your most humble servant.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_badtempered|I don't recognize the device on that banner. Clearly another foreigner come to our lands, bringing their strange ways.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_pitiless|I see that you carry a noble's banner, but I do not recognize the device... You should know, lady, that in Pendor it is the men who ride to war, and if you seek to overturn the natural order of things, you will find your fair head stuck on a pike - like any other rebel!
str_comment_intro_female_noble_cunning|It is not unheard-of for a woman to seek her fortune on the battlefields of Pendor, but neither is it usual. I shall be most interested in your progress.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_sadistic|You appear to be of noble rank, but I don't recognize your banner. Clearly, another foreigner come to our shores -- no doubt from a land where men are weak, and the women ride to war in their place!
str_comment_intro_female_noble_goodnatured|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Forgive my ignorance, my lady! It is good to make your acquaintance.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_upstanding|It is not every day that we see a woman caparisoned for war. Please do not take this amiss, my lady, for you have every right to protect yourself, but I cannot pretend to be fully comfortable with your decision to fight in battle. I would prefer that women be untouched by these wars, as I believe the female to be the custodian of what little gentility and tenderness remains to us.
str_comment_intro_female_admiring_liege|It is not often that I meet a woman who aspires to lead men into battle. But these are dark and troubled times, and I shall not scorn one who can wield a sword, should she be brave and loyal.
str_comment_intro_female_admiring_martial|Greetings, my lady. Although I see from your demeanor that you are a warrior woman, not a conventional maiden, I hope that you are not averse to a declaration of admiration from me, your most humble servant.
str_comment_intro_female_badtempered_admiring|Hah. Fancy this - a lady equipped for war. Well, it's a strange sight, but in your case, I can imagine that it might grow on me.
str_comment_intro_female_pitiless_admiring|It is unusual to see a woman girded for war. Be careful, my lady - it is a harsh world, and it would be a shame to see such beauty marred by a sword-blow.
str_comment_intro_female_cunning_admiring|Greetings, my lady. Please do not think it forward, if I say that it is unusual to see a woman caparisoned for war. I hope that one day I may be the father of a daughter possessed of such bravery and spirit.
str_comment_intro_female_sadistic_admiring|What have we here! A woman, caparisoned for war! Well, I dare say that one as fair as you could lend a touch of femininity even to a mail hauberk.
str_comment_intro_female_admiring_goodnatured|My lady, if you are skilled as arms as you are fair in countenance, then your enemies should indeed fear you!
str_comment_intro_female_admiring_upstanding|Greetings, my lady. Even with the dust of the march upon your clothes and gear, I can see that you are not lacking in the graces of your noble sex.
str_comment_intro_female_common_liege|It is not often that I meet a woman who aspires to lead men into battle. But these are dark and troubled times, and I for one will not turn away hands that can grip a sword, should their owner be brave and loyal.
str_comment_intro_female_common_martial|I suggest, my lady, that you take care how you ride about this dangerous land. If you ever wished to seek a more... em... settled life, I'm sure I could find you a worthy husband from amongst my men.
str_comment_intro_female_common_badtempered|By the way, girl -- does your husband know that you nicked his weapons and armor? I'll bet you're in for a right old beating when you get home!
str_comment_intro_female_common_pitiless|These are fallen times indeed, when even women turn brigand, to pick the leavings from the wreckage of war.
str_comment_intro_female_common_cunning|It is not unheard-of for a woman to seek her fortune on the battlefields of Pendor, but neither is it usual. I shall be most interested in your progress.
str_comment_intro_female_common_sadistic|A woman, caparisoned for war! Well, I suppose that you're no more womanly than most of those in my service who call themselves warriors.
str_comment_intro_female_common_goodnatured|From the look of you, I suppose you can handle yourself, but do be careful out there, my lady.
str_comment_intro_female_common_upstanding|It is not every day that we see a woman caparisoned for war. Please do not take this amiss, my lady, for you have every right to protect yourself, but I cannot pretend to be fully comfortable with your decision to fight in battle. I would prefer that women be untouched by these wars, as I believe the female to be the custodian of what little gentility and tenderness remains to us.
str_rejoinder_intro_female_common_badtempered|I won my weapons in battle. Care to test their - and my - mettle?
str_rejoinder_intro_female_noble_sadistic|Never mind my country. Here in Pendor, overtly drooling cretins lead men to war.
str_rejoinder_intro_female_common_sadistic|And you, sir, have manners as polished as any Jatu.
str_rejoinder_intro_female_noble_pitiless|Your words come from your arse - try using your mouth for a change.
str_rejoinder_intro_female_common_pitiless|These are parlous times, when ill-mannered idiots call themselves 'Lord'.
str_rejoinder_intro_noble_sadistic|Perhaps now I'll take your banner, your castle - and your life.
str_rejoinder_intro_female_pitiless_admiring|I'd be delighted to rearrange your face into a more pleasing visage, sir.
str_rejoinder_intro_female_common_upstanding|Would you care to experience the tenderness of my steel?
str_rejoinder_intro_female_noble_upstanding|Would you care to experience the tenderness of my steel?
str_rejoinder_intro_female_common_martial|How dare you? I don't go fishing in the jakes.
str_rejoinder_intro_female_sadistic_admiring|If you had on a horse's harness, I'd be hard put to tell your face from your arse.
str_rejoinder_intro_female_badtempered_admiring|If you're disturbed by the sight of me, I'd be pleased to put out your eyes.

str_comment_we_fought_in_major_battle_cruel|The wound I took at {s51} has healed properly and is scarcely scarred. I should have seen that blow coming! Still, we broke through their lines and sent them running, eh? What a sweet memory, indeed.
str_comment_we_fought_in_major_battle_quarrelsome|That was a fine fight near {s51}. The bastards ran like Erida Occisor herself was after their hides! Too bad for them it was us instead.
str_comment_we_fought_in_major_battle_upstanding|I still remember how bravely you fought in the great battle near {s51}. Let us praise the gods and never forget that victories are achieved only with their favor.
str_comment_we_fought_in_major_battle_default|Honored friend, I will not forget our battle at {s51}. It warms my heart to have fought by your side.
str_comment_you_defeated_a_lord_allied_liege|So, you crossed swords with that rascal, {s54}, and actually emerged victorious. I am very happy to hear that; it served him right.
str_comment_you_defeated_a_lord_allied_unfriendly_spiteful|A peddler told my captain of guard that you fought and defeated {s54}. Remember that day well, for it was a very lucky one for you!
str_comment_you_defeated_a_lord_allied_spiteful|I heard a rumor that you engaged and defeated that flea-ridden dog, {s54}. Ah, if only I could have heard him whimpering for mercy. I would have pissed myself laughing!
str_comment_you_defeated_a_lord_allied_unfriendly_chivalrous|You had a great victory over {s54}. I hope there isn't anything to the rumor that treachery played a part in your victory.
str_comment_you_defeated_a_lord_allied|In camp last night, I learned that you defeated {s54}. I hope you treated him chivalrously when you captured him.
str_comment_you_defeated_me_enemy_chivalrous|Last time we met, I found your tactics equal to those of a seasoned commander. Therefore, I do not begrudge you your victory, but I wish to restore my good name. Let us test our strengths once more!
str_comment_you_defeated_me_enemy_spiteful|I have been looking forward to meeting you again, trickster. Your shifty little ruses will not deceive me a second time. I will relish hearing your cries for mercy once I've defeated you.
str_comment_you_defeated_me_enemy|The last time we engaged one another, you had the better of me. However, {playername}, be assured that it will not happen again, for the gods favor my cause!
str_comment_i_defeated_you_enemy_spiteful|Back for more? Make me fight you again, and I'll feed your guts to my hounds, assuming they can stomach the reek of cowardice.
str_comment_i_defeated_you_enemy_chivalrous|Come to test your valor against me again, {playername}? Are you sure you're equal to such an audacious challenge?
str_comment_i_defeated_you_enemy_benevolent|Once again you come at me? Will you never learn? Wasn't last time humiliating enough for you?
str_comment_i_defeated_you_enemy_coldblooded|You are a persistent nuisance. I'll be rid of you as easily as I crush a louse.
str_comment_i_defeated_you_enemy|How many times must I chastise you before you learn to keep your distance? You should beg the gods to knock some sense into that thick head of yours! If they don't oblige, I certainly will!
str_comment_we_were_defeated_unfriendly_spiteful|The last time I saw you, you had been struck down by the men of {s54}. The blame for that disaster is entirely yours and it's a pity you survived that debacle.
str_comment_we_were_defeated_unfriendly|My men reported that you were captured and led off the battlefield by {s54}'s men. Got away, did you?
str_comment_we_were_defeated_cruel|Bad luck that {s54}'s men struck you down back there, {playername}. Don't worry - we'll find him and make him choke on his victory.
str_comment_we_were_defeated_default|I feared the worst when I saw you struck down by {s54}'s men. It is good to see you alive and well.
str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied_friendly_spiteful|My steward told me last night that {s54} gave you a hard time. Don't worry, my friend - I'll track him down and make you a gift of his head.
str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied_unfriendly_cruel|When I heard reports of {s54} slaughtering your men like sheep, I laughed myself sick at the thought of your demise! Damnit, now you turn up alive. What a disappointment!
str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied_spiteful|A fortnight ago I heard news that {s54} crushed you. Hah! Children should not meddle in games meant for grown-ups, little {reg63?boy:girl}!
str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied_pitiless|The dozen men I hanged last week wore your colors. Given that {s54} scattered your forces all over Pendor, I suppose they were reduced to banditry. That is most disappointing...
str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied_unfriendly_upstanding|Someone told me {s54} defeated you. No doubt your defeat was sent by the gods as punishment for your misdeeds, {playername}. I beg you, ask the gods to forgive your sins!
str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied_unfriendly|A couple of the lads from my fief, whom you enlisted, returned with the news that {s54} defeated you. Do try not to get too many of our men killed, won't you? Dead men can't harvest my grain or pay my taxes.
str_comment_you_were_defeated_allied|On my journey here, I heard the news that {s54} defeated you. Don't take it to heart - the tables will soon be turned!
str_comment_you_helped_my_ally_unfriendly_chivalrous|{s54} told me you saved him from likely defeat. Whatever else I think of you, I must at least commend you for aiding him.
str_comment_you_helped_my_ally_unfriendly|[relevance should be zero, and this message should not appear]
str_comment_you_helped_my_ally_liege|{s54} told me you rescued him from sure defeat and turned the battle in your favor. I appreciate such a noble and successful deed.
str_comment_you_helped_my_ally_unfriendly_spiteful|I heard that you rode to the rescue of our poor {s54}. Did you think him a damsel in distress? Quit fancying yourself a knight in shining armor - heroes always come to a bad end.
str_comment_you_helped_my_ally_spiteful|My castellan told me that you saved {s54} from a whipping. You should have left him to learn the lesson he richly deserves.
str_comment_you_helped_my_ally_chivalrous|Reports claim that you helped {s54} out of a tight spot. That was a noble deed, {reg63?sir:madam}.
str_comment_you_helped_my_ally_default|I heard that you got {s54} out of a tight spot. Good work! Our side needs more {reg63?men:women} who don't hesitate to intervene where needed!
str_comment_you_abandoned_us_unfriendly_spiteful|You bloody little coward! You left us to face {s54} on our own, while you ran for your life! I'll spit upon your grave, as I spit in your face right now!
str_comment_you_abandoned_us_unfriendly_pitiless|You abandoned me in the midst of the battle with {s54}. I'll see you stripped of your titles and land, and buried in a traitor's grave, you honorless turncoat.
str_comment_you_abandoned_us_spiteful|You left me in the middle of the battle with {s54}, like a rat abandoning a sinking ship - I trust you have a good explanation. Were you shaking too much to hold your weapon? Did your teeth chatter too loudly for you to hear my commands? Well?
str_comment_you_abandoned_us_chivalrous|What happened to you in the middle of that battle against {s54}? I needed you to reinforce my men, and you just left. I hope it was because you were carried off the field badly wounded, for I would be ashamed to have gone into battle alongside a coward.
str_comment_you_abandoned_us_benefitofdoubt|Why did you leave the battlefield just when I expected you to lead the charge into {s54}'s ranks? Were you wounded?
str_comment_you_abandoned_us_default|For the gods' sake, what happened? One moment you were fighting beside us against {s54}, and the next moment you were nowhere to be found! Where the hell did you go?
str_comment_you_ran_from_me_enemy_spiteful|Last time we met, you ran from me like a whipped dog. Have you come back to snarl at me again or just to whine for mercy?
str_comment_you_ran_from_me_enemy_chivalrous|At our last encounter, you galloped off in the opposite direction. Learn to stand and fight like a true warrior!
str_comment_you_ran_from_me_enemy_benevolent|When you fled from me, the last time we crossed swords, I had high hopes I'd never see you again.
str_comment_you_ran_from_me_enemy_coldblooded|Fleeing me was a wise decision, the last time ill luck led you to cross my path. Perhaps you should turn tail and run again, you sniveling coward.
str_comment_you_ran_from_me_enemy|You might have escaped the last time we crossed paths, but next time I'll not let you get away so easily!
str_comment_you_ran_from_foe_allied_chivalrous|Your enemies boast that you fled from {s54}, leaving your men behind to cover your retreat. I pray that is not true, for such behavior dishonors us all.
str_comment_you_ran_from_foe_allied_upstanding|{s54} said you ran from him, leaving your men behind to buy your escape with their lives. Desperate times inspire desperate measures, but you'd best look to your good name. Men will not fight in our armies if they think we'll abandon them on the field of battle.
str_comment_you_ran_from_foe_allied_spiteful|By the way, I hear you ran away from {s54} like a squeaking rat fleeing a terrier, leaving your men behind to be butchered. Hah! I'm damned sorry I missed that delightful sight!
str_comment_you_defeated_my_friend_enemy_pragmatic|Trickster! You may have bested {s54}, but you cannot defeat us all! I shall not be deceived by your clever little tricks!
str_comment_you_defeated_my_friend_enemy_chivalrous|Rumor has it that you were lucky enough to defeat {s54}. Ever since I heard that, I have wished to avenge him.
str_comment_you_defeated_my_friend_enemy_spiteful|Your fame runs before you, {playername}. {s54} may have fallen for your tricks, but if you fight me, you'll find me a much more slippery foe.
str_comment_you_defeated_my_friend_enemy|I hear you defeated {s54}. I will be a truer test of your skill at arms, since only sheer luck can give you victory over me.
str_comment_you_captured_a_lord_allied_friendly_spiteful|I understand you were able to capture {s54}. I hope you squeezed him for every denar in his treasury.
str_comment_you_captured_a_lord_allied_unfriendly_spiteful|I heard that you captured {s54}. Your coffers must be well-filled with ransom by now. Too bad that money alone cannot transform a low-born cur into a {reg63?gentleman:gentlewoman}!
str_comment_you_captured_a_lord_allied_chivalrous|Rumor has it that you managed to capture {s54}. Well done! I trust you treated him with the courtesy due his rank?
str_comment_you_captured_a_lord_allied|So you captured that old scalawag, {s54}? Despite the fact that he's a worthless piece of dung, his ransom should bring a pretty penny, given his rank and title.
str_comment_you_let_go_a_lord_allied_chivalrous|It came to my ears that you captured {s54}, but then let him go. Such chivalry is laudable.
str_comment_you_let_go_a_lord_allied_upstanding|I had a report that you captured {s54}, but released him without a ransom. Your action was honorable, but also rather stupid.
str_comment_you_let_go_a_lord_allied_coldblooded|I heard whispers that you captured {s54}, but allowed him to go free, which was certainly most chivalrous of you. You may wish to keep in mind that chivalry does not win wars.
str_comment_you_let_go_a_lord_allied_unfriendly_spiteful|So you were able to get your hands on {s54}. Why did you let him go? How very chivalrous of you! No doubt the widows and orphans he'll leave in his wake will want to thank you in person.
str_comment_you_let_go_a_lord_allied|Funnily enough, I heard that you captured {s54}, then released him without ransom. Well, I won't advise you on how to treat your prisoners, but you'd have done better to keep him under guard.
str_comment_you_let_me_go_spiteful|You had me at your mercy, yet allowed me to go free when I was unlucky enough to fall into your hands. I hope you enjoyed toying with me as a cat plays with a mouse. Soon I will have you at my mercy, to slay or humiliate according to my fancy.
str_comment_you_let_me_go_enemy_chivalrous|Despite my capture, you did not take advantage of the situation to enrich yourself, and allowed me an honorable leave. That was kind of you, and I will not forget it. Still, I must remember and keep the oath I gave to my liege, and our kingdoms are still at war.
str_comment_you_let_me_go_enemy_coldblooded|You were very stupid to allow me to go free when you captured me. We remain enemies, and I cannot promise to repay your mercy in kind.
str_comment_you_let_me_go_enemy|I thank you for sparing me humiliation and the payment of a hefty ransom when you had me at your mercy. That was kind of you, but we are still at war, and must remain enemies.
str_comment_you_let_me_go_default|You released me when you had the better of me and I was unlucky enough to fall into your hands. That was kind of you and I am glad that our kingdoms no longer war against one another. I may be able to repay that debt now.
str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_martial_unfriendly|My liege lord, {s54}, sent a messenger saying you had joined our cause. I trust you'll not disgrace us by behaving in a cowardly fashion.

str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_quarrelsome_unfriendly|Hmmpf... I heard that you pledged allegiance to our lord, {s54}. Bah. Do yourself a favor and stay out of my way.
str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_quarrelsome|I hear you swore allegiance to {s54} and were rewarded for your fealty. Fight hard against our foes but respect your betters. Most importantly, don't annoy me and we'll get along fine.
str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_selfrighteous_unfriendly|So {s54} accepted your pledge of fealty. Were I in his place, I would not trust you to clean the jakes.
str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_selfrighteous|I was informed that you pledged fealty to our lord, {s54}. Fight bravely and you will be well-rewarded. Betray us and we'll make a sufficiently fine example of you that future oathbreakers will think twice before betraying us.
str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_cunning_unfriendly|I heard that you joined our cause and {s54} took your oath. I do not pretend to be happy about his decision, but perhaps it is better to have you inside our tent pissing out, rather than outside pissing in.
str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_cunning|My lord {s54} tells me you pledged yourself to him. That is good. The more skilled fighters we have with us in these troubled times, the better  though I will watch your progress closely.

str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_goodnatured_unfriendly|I was informed you pledged yourself to our lord, {s54}. Well, I can't say that I would have trusted you that much, but perhaps you deserve the benefit of the doubt. I hope you'll prove yourself worthy of his trust.
str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_goodnatured|{s54}, sent news he had accepted your oath of allegiance. Good {reg63?man:woman}! Our lord is generous, and rewards loyalty and valor.
str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_upstanding_unfriendly|News is that you pledged yourself a vassal to {s54}. Alas, from what I know of you, you will disgrace our side quite shortly. Mind you, I'll not complain if you prove me wrong.
str_comment_pledged_allegiance_allied_upstanding|I heard you gave an oath of vassalage to {s54}. Fight our foes with valor, but retain your honor and compassion! A good name is as valuable as a sharp sword or a well-bred destrier.

str_comment_our_king_granted_you_a_fief_allied_unfriendly_upstanding|I wasn't overly pleased that {s54} granted you the fief of {s51}. Keep in mind that pride ever goes before a fall.
str_comment_our_king_granted_you_a_fief_allied_unfriendly_spiteful|It seems fortune favored you when {s54} granted you the fief of {s51}. I suspect, however, that fate has raised you up merely to humble you the more when you fall. It will be a pleasure to see you thrown back onto your dungheap.
str_comment_our_king_granted_you_a_fief_allied_spiteful|So {s54} has assigned you the fiefdom of {s51}? Let's hope you merit his generosity.
str_comment_our_king_granted_you_a_fief_allied|I heard that {s54} granted you {s51}. You seem to be doing very well for yourself. Continue as you have done, and you might advance further.

str_comment_you_renounced_your_alliegance_unfriendly_spiteful|I always had you figured as a traitor to {s54}, and now it seems that I was right! I hope you are brave enough to face your trial and execution for high treason with fortitude.

Let me tell you something -- I've had my eye on that one ever since I was a lad, and she was a lass.

str_battle_won_martial|There is no greater fortune than the chance to show one's prowess on the field of battle!
str_battle_won_quarrelsome|Hah! We showed those bastards a thing or two, didn't we?
str_battle_won_pitiless|Together, we will make the foe learn to fear our names.
str_battle_won_cunning|We must press our advantage, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, so the blood shed today is not wasted, but well-spent for victory.
str_battle_won_sadistic|Time to strip their dead and round up the wounded. The crows will feast on the dead and all will know the fate of those who come against us.
str_battle_won_goodnatured|Wasn't that a good scrap! There's no joy like the joy of victory, eh?
str_battle_won_upstanding|Now let us give thanks to the gods for our victory and mourn the many fine men who fell today. May their souls rest in peace.
str_battle_won_grudging_default|You turned the tide out there on the field today. Whatever I may think of you, I cannot fault you for your valor.
str_battle_won_grudging_martial|{playername} - you have shown yourself a worthy {reg63?man:woman} today, whatever your misdeeds in the past.
str_battle_won_grudging_quarrelsome|Hmmph. Yours is not a face I like to see but I suppose I must thank you for your help.
str_battle_won_grudging_pitiless|Your help out there was most valuable, {playername}. I don't imagine that you came to help me out of kindness, yet I thank you.
str_battle_won_grudging_cunning|It would be impolite not to thank you for rushing to aid me in my hour of need. So... thank you.
str_battle_won_grudging_sadistic|Well! How touching! {playername} has come to rescue me. Who'd have thought that would happen?
str_battle_won_grudging_goodnatured|{playername}! We've had our fair share of quarrels in the past, but you fought well today. My thanks to you!
str_battle_won_grudging_upstanding|Perhaps I was wrong about you. Your arrival was most timely. You have my gratitude, {reg63?Sir:Madam}.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_default|So you're here. Well, better late than never, I suppose.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_martial|We have had harsh words in the past, but let us enjoy our victory and forget them for the moment.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_quarrelsome|If you're waiting for thanks, don't hold your breath. Your help wasn't needed and I assume you joined us only because you had nothing better to do.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_pitiless|You arrive like a jackal to a lion's kill. Very well, help yourself to the spoils of my victory. I shall not stop you.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_cunning|{playername}... Well, I suppose your arrival didn't hurt, although I won't pretend I'm happy to see you.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_sadistic|Back off, you greedy vulture! This was my victory, however hard you try to steal the glory for yourself.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_goodnatured|Oh, it's you, {playername}. Well, I suppose I should thank you for your help - thank you.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_upstanding|Thank you for coming to my support. Now I'd best be off before I say something discourteous.
str_troop_train_request_default|I need someone like you to knock them into shape.
str_troop_train_request_martial|They need someone to show them the meaning of valor.
str_troop_train_request_quarrelsome|Fat,lazy bastards. In their current state, they're worthless.
str_troop_train_request_pitiless|They are more afraid of the enemy than they are of me, and that is unacceptable.
str_troop_train_request_cunning|Men, like steel, are tempered and hardened in fire.
str_troop_train_request_sadistic|I need someone to flog some courage into those cowards, or kill them trying.
str_troop_train_request_goodnatured|They're good enough lads but I am afraid that they're not quite ready for a battle yet.
str_troop_train_request_upstanding|It would be tantamount to murder to lead them into combat in their current state. Please see to it.
str_unprovoked_attack_default|What? Why do you attack us? Speak, you rascal, quickly!
str_unprovoked_attack_martial|I have no objection to a trial of arms, but I'd like to know your reason for attacking us.
str_unprovoked_attack_quarrelsome|You're making a big mistake, {reg63?boy:girl}. What the hell do you think you're playing at?
str_unprovoked_attack_pitiless|Indeed? If you really want to die today, I'll be more than happy to oblige you. I am curious as to what you hope to accomplish by throwing your life away.
str_unprovoked_attack_cunning|Really? I think that you are acting most unwisely. What do you hope to gain by this ridiculous challenge?
str_unprovoked_attack_sadistic|What's this? Do you want all your men slaughtered? If so, I'll gladly oblige you.
str_unprovoked_attack_goodnatured|Why do you challenge me? We've no quarrel, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, nor any reason for one - yet.
str_unprovoked_attack_upstanding|I consider this an unprovoked assault and will protest to your King. What is the meaning of this?
str_unnecessary_attack_default|I will not hesitate to cut you down if need arises. But I offer you the chance to ride away now.
str_unnecessary_attack_martial|I am eager to take up your challenge, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, although I will give you a minute to reconsider it.
str_unnecessary_attack_quarrelsome|Bah! I'm in no mood for this nonsense today. Get out of my way.
str_unnecessary_attack_pitiless|Since I'm in a merciful mood today, I'll pretend I did not hear you.
str_unnecessary_attack_cunning|I don't see what you hope to gain by making an enemy out of me. Perhaps you should reconsider your words.
str_unnecessary_attack_sadistic|I have no time to waste on you. Give way and crawl back into your hole.
str_unnecessary_attack_goodnatured|I don't see what you could possibly gain by picking this fight, {reg63?Sir:Madam}. Leave now, and live to see another day.
str_unnecessary_attack_upstanding|If a fight is what you wish, {reg63?Sir:Madam}, a fight you shall have. Still, I offer you the chance to back down and leave peacefully.
str_lord_challenged_default|As you wish. Prepare to die!
str_lord_challenged_martial|So be it. Defend yourself!
str_lord_challenged_quarrelsome|You impudent whelp! I'll crush you!
str_lord_challenged_pitiless|If you wish to die so badly, I have no choice but to oblige you.
str_lord_challenged_cunning|Well, since you leave me no choice...
str_lord_challenged_sadistic|You impudent dog! I'll make you curse the day your mother whelped you!
str_lord_challenged_goodnatured|Very well, I had hoped that we might avoid coming to blows but I see that I have no choice in the matter.
str_lord_challenged_upstanding|So be it. It saddens me that you will not listen to reason.
str_lord_mission_failed_default|Well, I am very disappointed in you. But I am sure that you will have other chances to redeem yourself.
str_lord_mission_failed_martial|There is no honor in failing a quest, but I will accept your word that you tried.
str_lord_mission_failed_quarrelsome|You failed? Bah! I should have expected as much from the likes of you.
str_lord_mission_failed_pitiless|You failed? You disappoint me, which is most unwise. Those who disappoint me seldom live long
str_lord_mission_failed_cunning|Well, I am disappointed, but no one can guarantee that the winds of fortune will always blow their way.
str_lord_mission_failed_sadistic|Indeed? Those who fail me generally do not live to regret it.
str_lord_mission_failed_goodnatured|Oh well, it was a long shot, at best. Thank you for trying.
str_lord_mission_failed_upstanding|So be it. I am sure that you gave it your best effort.
str_lord_follow_refusal_default|Follow you? You forget your station, {reg63?Sir:Madam}.
str_lord_follow_refusal_martial|On the day you prove yourself a true warrior, I may consider following you. But not today.
str_lord_follow_refusal_quarrelsome|Follow someone like you? I don't think so.
str_lord_follow_refusal_pitiless|Lords do not follow commoners, {reg63?Sir:Madam}.
str_lord_follow_refusal_cunning|First demonstrate that you will not lead me into disaster. Then, I may consider following you.
str_lord_follow_refusal_sadistic|I think not! Those of your station follow those of mine, rather than the reverse.
str_lord_follow_refusal_goodnatured|Uhmm, no. I am a bit pressed for time just now. Perhaps at a later date.
str_lord_follow_refusal_upstanding|Prove you're worth your salt as a leader before you request that I follow you.

str_rebellion_dilemma_default|[liege]
str_rebellion_dilemma_martial|{s45} was clearly wronged. Although I gave my oath to {s46}, it does not bind me to support him if he usurped the throne illegally.
str_rebellion_dilemma_quarrelsome|Hmm. {s46} has never given me my due, hence I don't owe him much. However, {s45} will be no better, and {s46} has shown himself a leader, at least.
str_rebellion_dilemma_pitiless|Hmm. {s45} says {reg3?she:he} is the rightful heir to the throne. That is good - it absolves me of my oath to {s46}. Still, I must weigh my decision carefully.
str_rebellion_dilemma_cunning|Hmm. I gave an oath of fealty to {s46}, yet the highborn are not bound by their oaths as are ordinary people. Our highest duty is to bring order and and justice to our people.
str_rebellion_dilemma_sadistic|Hmm. In this mercenary world, a wise man must think of himself, for no one else will. So - what's in it for me?
str_rebellion_dilemma_goodnatured|I do not know what to say. I gave an oath to {s46} as my lawful ruler. But... if he is not the lawful ruler, I don't know whether I am still oathbound or not.
str_rebellion_dilemma_upstanding|This is troublesome. It is a grave thing to declare my fealty to {s46} null and void, to dissolve the bonds which keep our land from sinking into anarchy. Yet I am pledged to support the legitimacy of the succession to the throne as well, and {s45} holds a valid claim.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_default|[liege]
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_martial|On the other hand, {s46} has led us in war and peace and I am reluctant to renounce my allegiance, for he leads us well.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_quarrelsome|Do tell me, why should I turn my back on the devil I know in favor of the devil I don't know?
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_pitiless|It is a most perilous position, and the question of whom I would make {reg3?ruler:king} of this land needs careful attention. Yet this presents an opportunity as well, and I may reap many rewards if I choose correctly.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_cunning|{s46} has been challenged and thus will never be able to rule as strongly as one whose claim is unquestioned. Yet if {s45} takes the throne by force, {reg3?she:he} will not be as well-supported nor be as strong as one who succeeded peacefully.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_sadistic|Perhaps if I join {s45} while {reg3?she:he} is still weak {reg3?she:he} will enrich me. On the other hand, if I bring {s46} your head, he will reward me with a large sum as well.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_goodnatured|{s46} has always treated me decently, yet he did wrong {s45}. I hesitate to renounce my fealty to {s46}, but my heart tells me I must not support injustice.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_upstanding|I feel that I must do whatever is best for the realm, to keep it from being ravaged by civil war or torn apart by its enemies.
str_political_philosophy_martial|My sword is at the disposal of my rightful liege, so long as he upholds his duty to me.
str_political_philosophy_quarrelsome|Bah. They're all a bunch of bastards. I try to make sure that the ones who wrong me learn to regret it.
str_political_philosophy_pitiless|Men will always try to cheat others of their rightful due. In this faithless world, each must remain vigilant of his own rights.
str_political_philosophy_cunning|Well, it's a harsh world, and it is our lot to face harsh choices. Sometimes one must serve a tyrant to keep the peace, but sometimes a bit of rebellion keeps the kings honest. Circumstance is all.
str_political_philosophy_sadistic|My philosophy is simple: it is better to be the wolf than the lamb.
str_political_philosophy_goodnatured|Well, you should keep faith with your promises, and not do injustice to others. Sometimes it's hard to balance those. Stick with people you trust, I think, and it's hard to go far wrong.
str_political_philosophy_upstanding|Kingship and lordship have been instituted to keep the peace and prevent the war of all against all, yet that must not blind us to the possibility of injustice.
str_political_philosophy_roguish|Hmm... I guess I'm thinking that it's good to be a lord.
str_political_philosophy_benefactor|A good ruler makes sure all are treated justly. Personally, I intend to use my authority to better the lot of those who live in my demesne.
str_political_philosophy_custodian|A good ruler creates the proper conditions for people to prosper. Personally, I intend to use my wealth to create more wealth, for myself and for the common benefit.
str_rebellion_prior_argument_very_favorable|I have already heard some arguments for supporting your candidate for the throne and I tend to agree with them.
str_rebellion_prior_argument_favorable|I have heard some quite convincing arguments for supporting your candidate so far and I tend to agree. We'll have a new {reg63?King:Queen}.
str_rebellion_prior_argument_unfavorable|So far only weak arguments for supporting your candidate have come to my ears. I do not find those reasons convincing at all.
str_rebellion_prior_argument_very_unfavorable|Anyone begging for support, employing such weak arguments as yours, is bound to fail, especially when discussing the royal succession.
str_rebellion_rival_martial|{s49} your ally {s44} once questioned my honor and bravery. I've hoped for the chance to cast his slanders in his teeth!
str_rebellion_rival_quarrelsome|{s49} you're working with {s44}. He's a shifty fellow and I don't trust him one bit.
str_rebellion_rival_pitiless|{s49} you seem to have enlisted {s44}, who is soft, weak and unfit to govern the most paltry fief. I have always detested the creature.
str_rebellion_rival_cunning|{s49} {s44}, who has already joined you, is headstrong, quarrelsome and will assuredly prove a liability to your cause.
str_rebellion_rival_sadistic|{s49} I have no desire to fight alongside your ally, {s44}. His nauseating displays of virtue revolt me.
str_rebellion_rival_goodnatured|{s49} I'd be reluctant to be on the same side as {s44}, who has quite a reputation for cruelty.
str_rebellion_rival_upstanding|{s49} your ally, {s44}, is a dangerous, unreliable, and highly unprincipled man. I despise him.
str_rebellion_argument_favorable|I respect your line of argument.
str_rebellion_argument_neutral|To be frank, I find your arguments compelling.
str_rebellion_argument_unfavorable|I haven't heard a less convincing line of argument since my sire's father died.
str_rebellion_persuasion_favorable|you eloquently state your case.
str_rebellion_persuasion_neutral|you make a reasonable case.
str_rebellion_persuasion_unfavorable|you have failed to make your case in a convincing manner.
str_rebellion_relation_very_favorable|I hold you in great respect.
str_rebellion_relation_favorable|I know and respect you as highly as I esteem your cause.
str_rebellion_relation_neutral|I do not know you as well as I would like. I must consider, before making such a decision.
str_rebellion_relation_unfavorable|I do not trust you. Enough said, begone.
str_and_comma_3|Furthermore, 
str_but_comma_3|However,
str_and_comma_1|, and 
str_but_comma_1|, but 
str_and_comma_2|. Moreover, 
str_but_comma_2|. Nonetheless, 
str_rebellion_agree_martial|I have decided to support {s45} as the rightful heir.
str_rebellion_agree_quarrelsome|Ahh, I've thought long enough. I never did like {s46} much anyway. Let's take his throne and give it to someone more appealing.
str_rebellion_agree_pitiless|You are fortunate indeed. I have decided to join your cause. Please do not give me reason to regret my decision.
str_rebellion_agree_cunning|This is a most dangerous decision, but after careful consideration I have decided to join you. Let's hope everything turns out well.
str_rebellion_agree_sadistic|I have decided to back your {reg3?woman:man} {s45}. You'd best make sure that {reg3?she:he} rewards me well or you'll curse the day I joined you!
str_rebellion_agree_goodnatured|I think your {reg3?woman:man} will be a good and worthy ruler. I'll join you.
str_rebellion_agree_upstanding|So be it. My first and foremost duty is to this realm. To save it from lawlessness I will back {s45} and renounce my homage to {s46}. May the gods forgive me if I do wrong.
str_rebellion_refuse_martial|Sorry, {s45} may have a good claim but it's not enough for me to turn my back on {s46}. I remain loyal to my liege and will fight his enemies wherever I encounter them.
str_rebellion_refuse_quarrelsome|Your whelp {s45} doesn't have what it takes to rule this realm. I'm sticking with {s46}.
str_talk_later_martial|Now is not the time to talk politics! Today I am accompanied by my fellow lords and armed for battle. You'd do better to prepare to fight, rather than wasting your time on useless words.
str_talk_later_quarrelsome|Do you expect me to discuss betrayal of my liege while we are surrounded by his army? What do you take me for, a bloody idiot?
str_talk_later_pitiless|Hold your tongue! Whatever I may have to say on this matter will not be said here, in the midst of our army.
str_talk_later_cunning|This is hardly the time or the place for such a discussion. Perhaps we can talk about this matter at a later time and in a different place, but for now we still are foes.
str_talk_later_sadistic|You should have your mouth sewn shut! Imagine what will happen if the other vassals see me talking to you about committing high treason!
str_talk_later_goodnatured|So you wish to discuss your rebellion with me? Try again, when we aren't surrounded by my liege's army, and I may decide to listen.
str_talk_later_upstanding|Whatever my thoughts on the legitimacy of the succession, I am not willing to discuss them here and now. If we meet again and can speak in privacy, I will hear what you have to say on the matter. For now, consider me your enemy.
str_rumor_lord_generic_1|The gossip is that {s6} doesn't like anyone but himself.
str_rumor_lord_generic_2|A neighbor has heard that {s6} admires his appearance greatly. He ordered his knights to polish their armors brightly enough for him to see his own reflection.
str_rumor_lord_generic_3|A tavern drunk said that {s6} eats so much garlic that he must employ retainers without a sense of smell.
str_rumor_lord_generic_4|I heard the gossip is that the local girls fear {s6}, not for their virtue, but that he will steal their dresses and undergarments.
str_rumor_lord_generic_5|I was told that {s6} once mounted his knights on cows, after someone stole his horses. His mooing warband actually won an engagement! He is now known as the cowherd knight!
str_rumor_lord_generic_6|My brother understands that {s6} is so paranoid that he has a personal spy watching him lest he attempt to form a plot against himself.
str_rumor_lord_generic_7|A neighbor said his steward says that {s6} is quite a loner. He seldom talks with even his best friends, thus no one really knows him.
str_rumor_lord_generic_8|I heard that {s6} is so fearful after that last assassination attempt that he ordered his guards to attack anyone, lord or peasant, who gets too close to him!
str_rumor_lord_generic_9|A town guard says the gossip is that {s6} loves music so much that he sings for his men, and even convinced two young knights join his concert during a festival.
str_rumor_lord_generic_10|I heard {s6} is looking for someone to teach him the Noldor language, so he can insult them properly during their next engagement.
str_rumor_lord_generic_11|I heard that those who serve under {s6} say he is greatly enamored of his own good looks, and constantly buys new helmets because of his fear of facial scars.
str_rumor_lord_generic_12|Someone said that {s6} is a heavy drinker who bears no love for warfare, and often after a battle holes up in his castle to enjoy a solitary drink.
str_rumor_lord_generic_13|A tavern drunk said that a soldier once told him that {s6} crossed a great river alone, when his army refused to attempt it. He wanted to prove that obstacles can be overcome by willpower. After he crossed, his shamed men followed.
str_rumor_lord_martial_1|I heard that {s6} loves nothing more than war, because he cannot perform as a man except on a battlefield.
str_rumor_lord_martial_2|A town guard said that {s6} sometimes whistles while speaking. People say that {s6} visits taverns, not for drinks and good company, but rather to fight. He lost several teeth brawling, hence his whistled words.
str_rumor_lord_martial_3|A neighbor said that tavern gossips say that {s6} once rode up to a large band of the Order of the Dragon and proceeded to challenge the lot to a duel. He was left minus one eye, half a leg and seven fingers, but he is admired by the Order for his bravery. Or his stupidity, perhaps!
str_rumor_lord_martial_4|My sister told me about that 'wife' of {s6}'s. He married a scarred-up Mystmountain barbarian, supposedly because he prefers rough trade to real women.
str_rumor_lord_martial_5|I heard that {s6} broke his arm in a wrestling contest with a berserker. Now, after beating him, his opponent is now his most trusted friend.
str_rumor_lord_martial_6|I heard that even women in the fief of {s6} are required to attend weekly archery practice.
str_rumor_lord_martial_7|I heard that {s6} lost his balls in a duel in his youth. Left him with a maiden's voice! He has dedicated his life to the art of war, since he could not sire an heir, poor sod.
str_rumor_lord_martial_8|I heard that {s6}, despite being surrounded by Noldors, managed not only to defeat them, but also personally killed at least five.
str_rumor_lord_martial_9|I once heard that {s6} is very prone to outbursts of anger when faced with the possibility of defeat. His anger frequently leads him to victory!
str_rumor_lord_martial_10|I heard a mercenary say that, despite begin a good strategist, {s6} often chooses poor commanders unable to execute his complex plans, and thus comes to ruin.
str_rumor_lord_martial_11|I heard people say that the secret to the victories {s6} achieves is his collection of old military treatises from strategists of the old Kingdom of Pendor.
str_rumor_lord_martial_12|I heard that {s6} is a very conservative man. In battle, he will use only old tried and true tactics, despite what his officers advise.
str_rumor_lord_martial_13|My brother says the word is that, during a siege, {s6} raced up the ladder to open a breach for his men to storm the castle.
str_rumor_lord_martial_14|A town guard told me about the time {s6} besieged a castle in his younger days. His commander was killed. The young lord donned the bloody armor his commander no longer needed and took control of the siege. He ordered a night attack, which took the castle off guard. He won the siege but lost an eye in the battle.
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_1|A town guard said that {s6} almost came to blows with another lord lately because the man made a joke about his nose. If you ever talk to him, best avoid mention of eagles, hawks, ducks, or anything else with a beak.
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_2|I was told that {s6} has been banned from all Pendorian debating societies for arguing too vehemently, and drawing his blade!
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_3|A neighbor said he once woke up to hear {s6} having a shouting match with a rooster. The strange thing was that he actually won!
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_4|My sister said that rumor has it {s6} once bit a dog who had bitten him. Puts new meaning into the term 'hair of the dog,' heh, heh.
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_5|I was told that {s6} is just as likely to lose his temper daily as that the sun will rise tomorrow morning.
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_6|Someone said that {s6} keeps a philosopher in his hall to guarantee himself a good debate every day.
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_7|My brother once heard {s6} complain about the excessive fixation people have with the old days. He thinks the best times are now, and he will offer passionate debate to anyone who states otherwise.
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_8|A tavern drunk said {s6} often complains that he has yet to meet someone who can offer him a good challenge. He regularly annoys the knights he meets in his crusade to find his equal at combat.
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_9|A neighbor said he once woke in the middle of night to the sound of {s6} bellowing to some unfortunate officer that he refuses to use cowardly tactics such as an ambush. He prefers to face enemies head on.
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_10|Someone said a merchant told him that he saw {s6} inform a young lady that her dress did not match her shoes and her hat was unfashionable for this season.
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_11|I heard from a Knight that ever since {s6} was cheated by a merchant, he shows them no mercy. Still, who knows exactly what the merchant did...?
str_rumor_lord_quarrelsome_12|My brother said that bastard {s6} managed to turn a diplomatic mission into a war! The king was late to the meeting where he was to present the peace treaty, so {s6} mouthed off to one of the king's guards while he waited. When the king arrived, he flung some choice insults at him, as well. That was the end of the peace offer!
str_rumor_lord_selfrighteous_1|I heard that {s6} executed a squire for killing a deer in his preserve. I fear the poachers hunting in his forests will bring down vengeance upon their villages.
str_rumor_lord_selfrighteous_2|A town guard said he had seen the sheriffs of {s6}, and claims they are equipped as well as the Knights of the Lion.
str_rumor_lord_selfrighteous_3|I heard that {s6} once forced a father to execute his own daughter for adultery.
str_rumor_lord_selfrighteous_4|A neighbor said a good friend told him that {s6} will carry out any sentence he thinks just, and says if his justicar will not order proper punishment, he'll do it himself.
str_rumor_lord_selfrighteous_5|I heard that {s6} was once a Knight of the Dawn before coming into his inheritance.
str_rumor_lord_selfrighteous_6|My brother said that {s6} once acquitted a man for murder. The plaintiff had stood on one leg and shot an arrow at the apple he placed on the victim's head. {s6} let him off because of some obscure law legalizing this particular scenario.
str_rumor_lord_selfrighteous_7|I heard that {s6} automatically hangs any man in his army who deserts his post.
str_rumor_lord_selfrighteous_8|I heard from a friend that {s6} spends an unhealthy amount of time writing and enacting new laws. Those who serve him complain that they can only sleep when he is occupied with his studies or writing.
str_rumor_lord_selfrighteous_9|My sister said she refused to believe that {s6} once ordered an artist to create a lot of portraits of him and then distributed them to all the taverns in his fief. Having a mug of ale with your lord's image glaring down at you must be quite disturbing!
str_rumor_lord_selfrighteous_10|The rumor is that {s6} is looking for a new way to mark time. He theorizes that he could get more work out of his peasants if he can regulate time. Heh, next he'll try telling the sun when it should rise!
str_rumor_lord_cunning_1|My brother says {s6} must have had a weasel in his ancestry, as he is a very cunning opponent.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_2|I heard that {s6} comes up with more cunning plans than a fox trying to get into a henhouse.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_3|I heard rumors that the Snake Cult want to recruit {s6} to make use of his sly and clever tactics.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_4|I was told that very few survive a battle against {s6} because his soldiers apply poison to their weapons before each battle.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_5|A neighbor said the current gossip is about young {s6}. While at university he adopted the philosophy: Power corrupts. Knowledge is power. Study hard. Be evil.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_6|A town guard said that {s6} is a true fox. He was being pursued, told his men to drop their weapons and armor and retreated into a swamp. He and his men got away with a few mosquito bites, but his pursuers in heavy armor sank into the bog's quicksand and perished to the last man.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_7|Rumor has it that {s6} was besieged by a army four times as big as his garrison. Damned if he did not open the gates wide for them. You'd think him a fool, but the besieging lords thought it a trap and promptly retreated.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_8|An upstart noble called Black Snake or something said that {s6} comes up with more cunning plans than a fox who has just been appointed professor of cunning at Janos University.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_9|I heard them say {s6} is stirred to a frenzy by the sight of his own blood.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_10|I was told that {s6} continued to fight with at least three Snake Cultist bolts in him! He did not even slow down until all the Cultists were dead.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_11|A neighbor says rumor is that {s6} often throws himself into desperate situations because he loves the thrill of the moment. People call him 'The Boar' - when cornered, he is just as dangerous.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_12|I was told that during a fierce battle, where he almost faced defeat, {s6} ordered his men to kill all their prisoners to prevent the enemy from rescuing them.
str_rumor_lord_cunning_13|I heard that {s6} is so paranoid about plots against him, he will send off members of his own family to far lands to prevent them from plotting against him!
str_rumor_lord_cunning_14|My brother said that {s6} once defended a bridge alone against several enemies, fighting heroically though drenched in blood from his and their wounds. He was laughing all the while he fought.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_1|Someone said many a condemned man walks from the dungeon of {s6} straight to the gallows. I wouldn't want to get on his bad side!
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_2|{s6} would rather swim in a tub of fresh blood than in a secluded lake, because the blood is warmer.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_3|I heard a rumor that {s6} hires torturers for his feasts in place of jesters.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_4|I was told that {s6} sat and played his fiddle while his village burned, rather than helping to douse the flames.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_5|I was told that {s6} offers his prisoners a choice: Kill and eat a fellow prisoner or die. Those who choose to indulge in cannibalism are then executed for it.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_6|My brother said that {s6} would rather watch an execution than retire for the evening with a lovely woman
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_7|A neighbor said that {s6} invented the guillotine because he wanted a faster way of executing his peasants.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_8|I heard that that those close to {s6} say he is a bad son, husband and ruler, a man who joys in the practice of all the worst vices.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_9|I was once told {s6} personally cuts off the heads of certain enemies after a battle to increase his collection. He supposedly has them stuffed, mounts them on his bedroom wall and talks to them. He reputedly wears a bracelet made of enemy teeth, too.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_10|I heard a terrible story about a village captured by {s6}! He spared no one, down to the smallest babes, but tortured them first in ways which would shame even Syla Uzas.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_11|My sister said {s6} is a bad ruler, despite his bravery and military skill. He has no consideration for his people, and will sell out the very things he was fighting for, if he thinks there is profit in the sale.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_12|I was told that {s6} kills those foes who surrender to him, after first urging them to surrender with a promise of mercy.
str_rumor_lord_sadistic_13|A town guard said the rumor is that {s6} once set fire to a small forest because he thought some enemies were hiding there. It spread and destroyed one of his villages.
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_1|Someone said that {s6} is praised by his tenants for treating his peasants quite well. That is more than can be said for most nobles!
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_2|My sister says one of {s6}'s knights claims that his lord once had a farting competition with a cow. The witnesses to this tasteful competition fainted from the smell before a winner was declared.
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_3|My mother says he once saw {s6} digging right alongside his villagers to raise the embankment that kept his village from flooding. He is a truly good man.
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_4|A neighbor said a traveler told him that {s6} opens his larder and storerooms and shares food with his peasants during a famine.
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_5|My brother said a proud mercenary told him that {s6} saved him from the gallows. {s6} conscripts convicted bandits who have not committed murder as mercenaries. Now this reformed man defends the very people he once robbed.
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_6|A tavern drunk said he saw a duel between {s6} and a prisoner who had pleaded the right to combat. {s6} let the man live even though killing him would have raised his own prestige and renown dramatically, because he put up such a good fight.
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_7|I was told the last time {s6} was in a village, he noticed most of the village cattle were bleeding after a recent wolf attack. He killed them out of pity, despite the horde of protesting peasants. Next day, he replaced every head, at his own expense, and the villagers feasted on the meat of the ones he killed!
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_8|My sister says rumor holds that {s6} once met a beggar, talked with him for several hours and then granted him a village. Most would think this a sign of a weak mind but, as the tale goes, the beggar was actually a good elder exiled from his former village because he refused to execute his own daughter for adultery.
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_9|I heard from a traveler that {s6} sometimes travels to one of his villages with bards, jesters and wine. He actually holds a feast for his peasants!
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_10|A town guard said that {s6} is highly praised by his men because of his courage: he once defeated three Anaconda Knights in one on one duels
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_11|They say {s6} is like the sun, his splendor and light are so great that his people fear to look at him directly lest they go blind. Sounds to me like my lord's propaganda mill is working overtime!
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_12|I was told that the mercy {s6} exhibits is in fact a weakness; people manipulate him, he knows it, but still does nothing.
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_13|My brother says the word is that {s6} tries his best to prevent his men from harassing villagers. It is good to know that people like him exist.
str_rumor_lord_goodnatured_14|I heard that once {s6} forgave the debts of some of his poorest subjects because heavy rains had ruined their fields.
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_1|A town guard said the minions of {s6} claim they could do worse than serve him. He is good to his followers and rewards them if they work well. His court delivers equal justice to men of both high and low station.
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_2|I was told that {s6} once sat on a rock by the shore and commanded the tide to stop coming in. He got very wet. Crazy, no? He did it to demonstrate to his people that no lord, however powerful, can command nature!
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_3|I was told that {s6} sometimes roams incognito among the people in order to learn firsthand their problems. Wait, who did you say you were again?
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_4|My brother said he heard that {s6} once defended a village single-handedly from marauding bandits. I wish all knights acted with such bravery.
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_5|A neighbor says people told him that {s6} enlists captured poachers into the ranks of his personal huntsmen.
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_6|A tavern drunk says that {s6} is far too good and kind to agree with the beliefs of the Order of the Dawn.
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_7|I heard from a man at arms serving under {s6} that no man upholds justice so firmly as he: he once disbanded a soldier for stealing a hat, another time he hanged three men because they assaulted a young peaant girl.
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_8|Someone said he once saw {s6} enact a law, then only two minutes later return and announce he had found a loophole in it. He ended up enacting the same law five times before he was satisfied all the loopholes were closed.
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_9|I was told that {s6} has instituted numerous investigations in his domain for signs of heretical activity.
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_10|A town guard said {s6} took a castle - nothing special, you might say, but his method of taking it was carved into his memory! He rode alone into the castle and proposed a parley. They parleyed over wine and agreed that {s6} might take the castle for the duration of the war, but he swore he would return it to its lord when peace was made. Damned if {s6} did not keep that promise, too!
str_rumor_lord_upstanding_11|My sister says a merchant told her that {s6} banned all music in his domain for several days, because he thought the peasant songs too heretical. The peasants thought him worse than a Knight of Dawn.
str_latest_rumor|The latest rumor you heard about {s6} was:
str_changed_my_mind_martial|However, your stirring words make me reconsider my position.
str_changed_my_mind_quarrelsome|But I think you've talked me into it anyway, you bastard. I'm still listening
str_changed_my_mind_pitiless|But when you plea like that, I will deign to reconsider.
str_changed_my_mind_cunning|But you know, you're a well-spoken bastard. That impresses me. I'm still listening.
str_changed_my_mind_sadistic|But as your silver tongue sings so pretty a song on your behalf, I will not dismiss the idea just yet.
str_changed_my_mind_goodnatured|But you make a good case, so I'll try to keep an open mind.
str_changed_my_mind_upstanding|However, you make an eloquent case. I am still listening.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Sir Darlion, rightful King of Sarleon and all Pendor.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_intro|My name is Madam Ursula of Senderfall, and I am the rightful Queen of Ravenstern.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Xerxes, son of Iskander Bahadur Khan, rightful Bahadur Khan of the D'Shar Principalities.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Inar Ironhand, First Axe of Windholm and rightful Koningur of all the Fierdsvain. None may rightly dispute my right to rule.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Demosthenes of Cez, rightful Imperator of the Empire, and the man who will one day free them from tyranny.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_1|My great-great grandfather was the acknowledged bastard son of King Cavalas of Pendor. He was eighth in line for the throne as he was acknowledged -- not once, but several times, before the grandest nobles of the land, that none could doubt his lineage.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_1|My father died when I was young, leaving me in the care of his sister, Amethea of Senderfall, and naming me his lawful heir. I spent most of my girlhood training for the day that I would ascend the throne of Ravenstern. Yet, that was not to be. My younger brother Gregory, who was ever one to crave power, managed to convince the Northern Lords that a woman should not sit upon the throne of the North. He pressed his claim, and was named legal heir and then crowned King.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_1|Kadan and I are brothers, sons of the old Bahadur Khan, though we had different mothers. Although I was the younger brother, all those who knew the old Bahadur Khan will testify that throughout my father's life, I was his favorite, entrusted with the responsibilities of government. Kadan busied himself with hunts and feasts to win over the more dissolute of my father's khans.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_1|I am called Ironhand for the strength of my axe in battle. I bring fear and death to all my foes. I have met and defeated Valdis, that coward, in a challenge of personal combat. As victor, by the rights of our heritage, I am owed a boon. I chose his lands and title, as was my right, but he refused to honor the traditions of our ancestors.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_1|The Citizens of the Empire are a free people, and not slaves to any hereditary monarch. The Imperator is chosen from amongst the leading noble families of our land, by a council drawn by lot from the patricians of the cities of Ethos, Cez and Janos. The council meets on a field before Janos, and no man is allowed to appear bearing arms during their deliberations, on pain of death.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2|When the plague struck down the royal family, only my great-great grandfather survived. He should have been declared the King of Pendor, but Duke Alfred whisked him away and sold him into slavery, proclaiming that he had died with the rest of the royal family. He finally escaped and returned to Pendor, only to find jackals ruling the lands in his stead. None would believe his words and he spent his life trying to claim his heritage. For four generations, my family has attempted to prove the truth of these claims, and we now have the proof we need.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2|Since that day I have lived as a Knight of the Falcon, a valiant Knighthood order once based in Rane. Though I am a woman, I have proven myself worthy of knighthood, by valor on the field of battle. The day that I was knighted, Gregory outlawed the Order of the Falcon and put bounties upon all our heads. Those warriors would have followed me to claim my birthright, had any survived.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2|According to D'Shar custom, when a man dies, his possessions are split amongst all his sons, equally. When I heard of my father's death, I was away across the Western Sea on a diplomatic mission, but I hurried home to Torbah, ready to give Kadan his due and share the Principalities with him. When I arrived, I found that he had rushed his supporters to the court, and had himself proclaimed Bahadur Khan.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2|We of the Fierdsvain are warriors born! We take what we want by the might of our axes! Valdis accepted my challenge and I beat him. I have a legitimate claim to the throne that, by the traditions of our ancestors, must be legally recognized.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2|During the last selection, there were but two candidates, Lord Marius and me. While the council deliberated, Marius appeared, sword in hand, telling them that a D'Shar raiding party was about to descend on the field of deliberation -- which was quite true, by the way, since he had hired them -- and if he were not elected king, he would leave them to their fates.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3|I have the royal signet which is only activated by the blood of the royal line of Pendor. As you can clearly see, this ring glows with the sign of the Griffon, the signet of the line of Cavalas. I will admit that I did my cause no good by denouncing Ulric and all who refused to acknowledge my claim as traitors. No matter -- I will raise an army of loyal subjects, who honor the memory of Pendor's royal line. If any doubt the justice of my cause, I will prove them wrong and seize Ulrics' ill-gotten crown by force.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_3|Until my rights are restored in the sight of all the lords of the North, I will endeavor to thwart my brother, that usurper and false king of glorious Ravenstern. This I have sworn upon my sword and upon the grave of our father. One day he will fall to my blade on the field of battle and his treachery will be at an end.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3|My brother thinks the D'Shar only respect strength: a leader who takes what he wants, when he wants it. I think he misunderstands the spirit of our people. We admire a resolute leader, but even more, a just one. A man who does not respect his own brother's rights cannot be trusted to respect the rights of the tribes.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3|Valdis believes that the men of Fierdsvain will follow a weakling oath breaker. He is wrong! We respect strength and honor. I will raise an army and take what is due me, beginning with the lands that I have won and ending with his gold in my coffers and his women in my bed!
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3|Marius defeated the D'Shar, betraying those he had hired. As a Citizen of the Empire, I am grateful for all dead D'Shar, whether they are killed by valor or treachery. Once I am Imperator, I will myself place a laurel wreath upon his head, just before I remove it from his shoulders. He has proven himself a traitor, both to the Empire and our sacred traditions.
str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Darlion thinks he should be King of Sarleon? He's nothing but a young whelp with delusions of grandeur. He has no experience in ruling a kingdom, even if his claim was valid, which it is not. My grandsires heard and dismissed his family's fabricated claims over a hundred years ago. Those claims were invalid then, and his magicked little trinket does not make them valid today.
str_vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1|If Ursula were a man, she would no doubt have been a strong King. But, she is not a man, and no self respecting warrior of the North will follow a woman. Further, she has taken up arms as a knight. No King accorded her that honor. I outlawed that Order of hers for overstepping their authority in granting her knighthood.
str_khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1|My brother Xerxes has doubtless told you of his plan to divide the Principalities, as though it were a herd of horses. I tell you this:  Ever since the D'Shar were nothing more than desert goatherds, the death of every Khan has produced the same result -- lands divided, the Khan's sons at war, and in the end, the strongest held it all. I merely avoided the inevitable civil war, which would have caused unnecessary D'Shar deaths.
str_nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Inar Ironhand? Inar Ironbrain is more apt. You may have noticed that mentally, he is not the sharpest arrow in the quiver? Yes we had duelled a few years ago, a friendly drunken test of arms during a hunting trip. I knew I would lose, he is, despite his lack of of intelligence, a very strong warrior. I offered him a boon, thinking he would ask for a sword, or a purse of gold. I was shocked sober when he demanded my title and lands. I offered him his weight in gold and three of my slave girls to entertain him, but he flatly refused, and once again demanded the Fierdsvain.
str_rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1|No doubt Demosthenes told you that I defied hallowed Empire custom by interfering with the patricians' election of their Imperator. Let me tell you something: The patricians make longwinded speeches about our ancient liberties, and pretend to deliberate. They then choose as Imperator whichever noble last sat in their villa, sipping a fine wine, while promising to overlook their leanings towards the Snake Cult.
str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2|This is an old dispute between our families, but it was settled long ago. It demonstrates Our justice and mercy that We have not dealt more harshly with him and his claims. Do not waste time on his fables, when there are real threats at hand, from those who would put our people to the sword without a second thought. 
str_vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2|Whatever my father may or may not have done to secure the throne does not matter. I sit upon it, and that is final. If every old claim were to be brought up anew, if every man's inheritance could be called into question at any time, then it would be the end of the institution of kingship, and we would live in a state of constant civil war.
str_khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2|Xerxes would make a fine assessor of taxes, or adjudicator of land disputes. But, can you imagine such a man as Bahadur Khan? Our neighbors would seize our land in an instant, and we D'Shar would return to starving and freezing in what was once our own great desert.
str_nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2|The tradition of victory through personal combat was fine when we were landless raiders out of Vanskerry and our survival depended upon our strength of arms. Today, our survival requires both strength and cunning. Inar has the cunning of a dead fish.  My duty is to the Fierdsvain and my people, to my thegns who require gold and women to keep them happy. I tolerate this fool magnanimously, but if he presses his claim by force, I will teach him and his followers the difference between a war leader and a Koningur.
str_rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2|The only liberty that concerns the Empire citizens is the liberty to grow fat. To protect them, my men sleep in the open, eating dry bread and salt fish, scanning the horizon for burning villages. They shed their blood to keep the caravan routes open. Whenever I meet a merchant who limps from a Jatu lance, a D'Shar arrow-wound or a Fierdsvain sword-stroke, then I say, 'Here's a man whose counsel is worth taking.'

str_rumor_talk_burilgi_1|He heard talk of a gathering of many tribes in the desert.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_2|He said that the D'Shar tribes whisper of uniting in support of some desert prophet who is supposedly in the grip of holy madness.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_3|He overheard people talk of the Prophet of the Desert and some say that the Usurper will put to the torch all that he deems unclean.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_4|He said that people are talking of a strange prophet gathering strength in the desert.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_5|Tales abound of a mad Prophet uniting numerous D'Shar tribesmen who are coming from the deep desert.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_6|People are talking of some madman in the deep desert who is allegedly stirring up the D'Shar. I hear the Bahadur Khan is most annoyed about the situation
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_7|He encountered a band of D'Shar warriors heading into the deep desert to join a prophet named Burilgi. They were very intent and seemed in a hurry.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_8|He has heard that the desert Usurper Burilgi is reputed to use some kind of drug to enslave his followers. He deprives them of it before a battle, and they fight like wild beasts, because if they do not win, he tells them they will have no more of it.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_9|He came upon a camp of young men who were hunting for their relatives, nary a one over twelve years of age. They said that their fathers and brothers had deserted their clan to seek the Holy Prophet of the Desert.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_10|He came upon a poorly-dressed wanderer in his travels, who said he was the Herald of Burilgi the Destroyer. I am not sure who this Buriligi is, but he sounds ominous.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_11|He heard rumors that someone called Buriligi has gone mad from his religious beliefs, and foams at the mouth in a frenzy when he addresses his followers.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_12|He has overheard talk in the D'Shar Territories that Buriligi the Usurper never leaves his desert, but woe betide those who venture over the river near Torbah without his permission.
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_13|He was accosted by two women calling themselves Omen Seekers, wanting to know if he had seen a white hawk. They said that they were on a vision quest given to them by the Desert Usurper. Very odd, don't you think?
str_rumor_talk_burilgi_14|He spotted three women dressed for battle on swift steeds. They were riding into the desert at a full gallop.
str_rumor_talk_alaric_1|He came across a group of men driving wagons filled with casks of ale, asking if he knew the whereabouts of Alaric von Brouhaha.
str_rumor_talk_alaric_2|He said that there have been rumors of an uprising of sorts, with deserters and bandits joining an upstart bandit lord.
str_rumor_talk_alaric_3|He came across a group of women in a wagon who were looking for the camp of the Glorious Army of Ale Drinkers. I have never heard of such a thing!
str_rumor_talk_alaric_4|He encountered several peasants with sickles, hunting knives and pitchforks who were looking to join the army of Alaric Von Brouhaha.
str_rumor_talk_alaric_5|The farmers and commoners are talking excitedly of a peasant general named Alaric who is challenging the King!
str_rumor_talk_alaric_6|Two scouts stopped him and asked him about the whereabouts of the bloody outlaw Aleric Von Brouhaha. Of course he had no idea.
str_rumor_talk_alaric_7|He was camped for a few days with a band of outlaws, who were debating whether or not to join the famous outlaw Alaric Von Brouhaha.
str_rumor_talk_alaric_8|He came across three very inebriated soldiers, who found, got drunk, and subsequently lost the whereabouts of the camp of Alaric Von Brouhaha.
str_rumor_talk_alaric_9|He claimed to have encountered someone named Alaric Von Brouhaha and was not allowed to escape until he was drunk to the point of illness. What a ridiculous tale!
str_rumor_talk_alaric_10|He heard from a trader that someone named Alaric Von Brouhaha had raised an army of peasant rabble, complete with torches and pitchforks and drunk to boot. Preposterous!
str_rumor_talk_alaric_11|He passed through a village which was almost deserted. One old man still there said that most of the villagers had left to join Alaric Von Brouhaha.
str_rumor_talk_alaric_12|Alaric von Brouhaha drank every drop of ale in the inn yesterday, and there is none to be had here tonight. What a sot that peasant is!
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_1|He heard that one Wolfbode the Slayer claims that his god, Vejovis, visited him in a vision, and told him he would be his instrument to reclaim all Ravenstern for the Mystmountain clans.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_2|He told me that Wolfbode the Slayer not only leads an army of his barbarian clansmen, but also recruits bandits and outlaws to fight for him. He promises them land in Ravenstern as a reward. 
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_3|He said that merchants in the Ravenstern market whisper that Wolfbode the Slayer has sworn to eliminate every man, woman and child in Ravenstern, because that land belongs to his people, and only the clans may dwell there.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_4|He heard from a trader that he saw a great army, led by a barbarian chief, just past Poinsbruk. He ran for his life and barely escaped them. He said the army seemed immense.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_5|He laughed, and said a knight had told him that King Gregory soils his armor at the very thought of facing Wolfbode the Slayer. Hah, that is likely not the only foe he fears. He is probably even more afraid of Madam Ursula.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_6|He said the Garrison Commander of Rane is reinforcing their troops, in case Wolfbode the Slayer attacks them. Bah, the clans do not besiege towns, they are just barbarian Raiders.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_7|His story was of an outlaw, who told him that he deserted the army of Wolfbode the Slayer, because he thinks Wolfbode is insane. He supposedly claims to be possessed by that Mystmountain cat god, Vejovis. A likely story!
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_8|I heard a bandit say he heard Wolfbode the Slayer boast that his hand was guided by his god, Vejovis, who had promised him that all Ravenstern would soon belong to those bloody barbarian clans. 
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_9|He said an acquaintance of his, a Ranger, told him that his entire warband was wiped out in less than ten minutes by the army of Wolfbode the Slayer. His Lord, of course, bought his own life with the lives of his men, who covered his retreat.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_10|Rumor hath it that the Mystmountain Clans are united under a great warrior, Wolfbode the Slayer, who intends to conquer all Ravenstern for his people.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_11|He was informed that even UllrVetr may fear the incursions of Wolfbode the Slayer into Ravenstern, for his god, Vejovis, fights with his army in the form of a ferocious mountain cat.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_12|He told of a savage barbarian army, led by one Wolfbode the Slayer. He is reputed to be somewhere at large just above Ravenstern in the mountains.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_13|He said that many mountain men, outlaws and bandits are flocking to the banner of a Mysmountain hero named Wolfbode.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_14|He said that there have been many sightings of barbarian scouting parties which, in the past has been a sign of impending invasion.
str_rumor_talk_wolfbode_15|He said that in Poinsbruk three women were abducted by a barbarian raiding party right under the watch commanders nose. Rumors are that it was Wolfbode himself who sneaked into the town.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_1|He said that a Sarleon militiaman discovered the bodies of some knights who had tangled with K'Juda the Ravager. Before they were tortured to death, their eyes had been gouged out.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_2|He heard tell that even the Jatu fear K'Juda the Ravager, because he executes his own men when he is angry, without warning. I wonder that anyone rides with him, if that is how he behaves to his own men!
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_3|He said that one of the militia told him that they had captured a lone Jatu, who said one known as K'Juda the Ravager intended to unite all the Jatu tribes and move against Ravenstern.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_4|He heard from a trader how he came upon a band of dead Noldor in the forest. There was a javelin stuck in one of them, holding a proclamation from someone named K'Juda, stating that all Noldor would meet the same fate shortly.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_5|He overheard some Sarleon knights talking about a battle they had seen between the Noldor and some Jatu fellow. They said even the Noldor could not stand against the overwhelming forces of the Jatu.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_6|He heard rumors in Poinsbruk that the Jatu are being forcibly united under the banner of one K'Juda, called 'the Ravager' for his fearsome rages.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_7|He heard that a trader from Senderfall was here getting drunk last night. He had abandoned all his goods and fled from a pack of Jatu warriors led by someone called 'K'Juda.'
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_8|He encountered a traveler a few nights back, ashen-pale and trembling. He said he had seen that Jatu, K'Juda, torturing a group of Ravenstern knights for information on Poinsbruk's defenses. He heard the screams from a furlong away.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_9|He has heard that K'Juda, that evil Jatu warlord, claims to be the earthly embodiment of the Jatu god, Indar. A fine god he must be - the Jatu claim he shoots them in the back in battle, if he thinks they are cowards.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_10|He heard that some of the Jatu are hiding out from K'Juda the Ravager, a Jatu warlord who plans to forcibly unite them all, and field them against the Sarleon army.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_11|He said that a fellow he knew, who sometimes trades with the Jatu tribes, says that soon they will take over Ravenstern, because their Lord, K'Juda, has promised them Indar will secure their Victory.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_12|He was told the Jatu are in turmoil just now, because not all of them wish to do the bidding of some warlord called 'K'Juda the Ravager.' Charming name, would you not say?
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_13|He heard a trader say that the only good thing he ever heard about K'Juda the Ravager is his talent for killing Noldor, or so they say in Laria. They say he has a magic bow and never misses his target.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_14|He heard that K'Juda the Jatu likes to mount Noldor heads on poles outside his tent. I heard he had dozens of skulls there now.
str_rumor_talk_kjuda_15|He heard that K'Juda the Ravager likes to inflict pain on his captives by torturing them. He likes to hear them scream for days before they finally die.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_1|he heard some Sarleon knights say that, for all Warlord Zulkar is a damned Jatu, he fights like a brave and honorable man.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_2|He heard the Jatu are voluntarily uniting under a powerful warlord, called Zulkar. He has promised to restore what the Jatu deem their 'lost glory.'
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_3|He said that a rumor has it that the Jatu Warlord, Zulkar, fights more fiercely than a cornered lion. His skills are supposedly unsurpassed.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_4|He said that some say even the Noldor tread carefully when Warlord Zulkar is in their vicinity. As you doubtless know, the Jatu despise the Noldor.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_5|He heard from a Ravenstern Warden that the forces of Warlord Zulkar grow larger by the week, and that he plans to take all Pendor for his tribes to roam.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_6|He heard that Warlord Zulkar has whipped yet another of the Noldor Warbands. At this rate, he'll pitch his tent in the hidden Elven city before they know it.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_7|He heard that Warlord Zulkar has an honor guard so fierce that none can get past them. Of course, even if they did, there would still be Zulkar to deal with!
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_8|He said that when the Jatu grow restless, they quote a proverb that tells of a Warlord of warlords who will arise to lead them. From what I hear, it has come to pass.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_9|He repeated that old saying, 'When the Jatu unite in force, trouble is on the hoof!' As per rumors in Laria, that is happening now.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_10|He said that even the Noldor fear the ferocity of Warlord Zulkar, though they grudgingly respect his battle prowess.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_11|He said that some hot-headed young Sarleon lords took on Warlord Zulkar not long ago. They will not be fielding armies again anytime soon, I would warrant.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_12|He has heard rumors that the Jatu, Warlord Zulkar, is at large upon the Jatu hills and plains, sweeping all before him with his powerful force.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_13|He heard that King Ulric fears Warlord Zulkar will own all Sarleon one day. 
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_14|He heard a story from a lone Ravenstern Ranger who was in a battle with the Jatu Warlord Zulkar. The Ranger fired an arrow from 50 paces at Zulkar and was certain that it would slay him. Zulkar caught the arrow with his hand, snapped it in two and continued fighting.
str_rumor_talk_zulkar_15|He heard rumors that the Lords of Ravenstern are organizing a very large troop of Knights of the Dragon to deal with Warlord Zulkar.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_1|He was informed by a reliable source that an Adventuring company, headed by one Oswald de Fleur, is causing great trouble in the Fierdsvain.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_2|He has heard on the grapevine that the Ravenstern Lords will not challenge Oswald de Fleur, because they are afraid of him. 
str_rumor_talk_oswald_3|He asked if I had heard of Oswald de Fleur. He said that if you run into his company, never challenge him - you'll surely come to grief if you do.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_4|He said that a Ravenstern trader told him that he had lost four caravans now to an adventure company led by Oswald de Fleur. His raiding has increased in frequency and the traders are furious.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_5|He said that the Fierdsvain farmers have petitioned the Koningur to eliminate an adventurer known as Oswald de Fleur. He has raided their villages repeatedly.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_6|He said that rumor hath it that even the Vanskerry Raiders prefer to avoid that adventurer, Oswald de Fleur. His shield is covered in the flayed skin of a Vanskerry Jarl, I've heard.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_7|He said that one of the Ravenstern Warders told him that both the Koningur and King Gregory have offered a fine reward for the head of one Oswald de Fleur.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_8|He mentioned that if rumor does not lie, Oswald de Fleur just defeated a group of Vanskerry Raiders three times the size of his own company.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_9|He said that Oswald de Fleur, the mercenary Adventuring Company captain, usually deploys his men in small groups, but when they combine, beware!
str_rumor_talk_oswald_10|He said that he encountered Oswald de Fleur and some of his men last week. They are a really scary lot.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_11|He said that with just one glance from his cold, dead eyes, Oswald de Fleur can stop the boldest warrior in his tracks.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_12|He said that if you have occasion to hire Oswald de Fleur, it is very wise to pay him exactly as agreed. He told a dreadful tale of what happens to those who cross him.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_13|He heard a rumor that the Adventuring Companies under Oswald de Fleur have been summoned to unite for a secret mission.
str_rumor_talk_oswald_14|He said that he ran into several landless Knights sent by Oswald de Fleur to discover the whereabouts of someone named {playername}. Would that be you?
str_rumor_talk_oswald_15|He said that he encountered a squire who was in the service of Oswald de Fleur and had been summoned to join a large mercenary company forming near Windholm.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_1|He said that company run by Meregan Kierlic has some damned hot women in it, but those lassies will kill you in a blink, if you offend them.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_2|He has heard rumors that Meregan Kierlic, leader of the Griffonsword Company, would sell his own mother into slavery, if he could make a few denars on the deal.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_3|He heard that an Empire Lord is now completely bankrupt from paying his ransom to Meregan Kierlic.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_4|He told me that Meregan Kierlic researches the assets of the Fierdsvain Lords, so he knows to the last denar what to charge them for ransom.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_5|He said that the Legionnaires would dearly love to get their hands on Meregan Kierlic. He captured twenty of their number and sold them into slavery because they refused to join his company.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_6|He said that the Griffonsword Company will hire out for the right price, but you cannot trust them to stay loyal.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_7|He had heard that those women in the Griffonsword Company, whew! They are as deadly as they are beautiful. Certainly, some of them are lookers, all right.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_8|He heard that when an Empire Lord tried to engage the Griffonsword Company, Meregan Kierlic demanded 10,000 denars up front. When the Lord refused, he backhanded him and stalked from the hall.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_9|He heard that the Griffonsword Company is apparently on a rampage in the Fierdsvain again. Supposedly, Meregan Kierlic is annoyed with the Koningur about something.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_10|He said that the ladies of the Griffonsword Company are amazingly beautiful! And every one of them is a hardened killer, so I am told.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_11|He heard a group of Maiden Noble deserted to join the Griffonsword Company because Meregan Kierlic treats all his troops equally, whether they be men or women.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_12|He said that one of the Empire Lords decided to raid a caravan guarded by the Griffonsword Company. He will not try that again, I hear, even if he does recover from his wounds.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_13|He said that he ran into a warrior missing his nose. One of the warrior women in the Griffonsword Company cut it off because he made lewd gestures to her in a tavern.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_14|He said that he met a Maiden Noble who left the service of her lord to join the ranks of the Griffonsword Company.
str_rumor_talk_meregan_15|He heard a rumor that the Empire Legionnaires are preferred targets of the women from the Griffonsword Company. Each Maiden Noble carries a small pouch on her belt, where she keeps her 'Legionnaire souvenirs'.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_1|He said that every bandit in Pendor knows better than to attack a caravan escorted by Kodan Ironsword. Even the Vanskerry Raiders avoid him, and with good cause, from what I hear.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_2|He has heard the local merchants are squealing like stuck pigs over the latest depredations of Kodan Ironsword. He has raided nine caravans in the last week, because the merchants refused to pay him 'protection' gold.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_3|He said that, despite the fact that the Ironsword Company is largely composed of Vanskerry Raiders, the Lords all hire him to escort their wives when they travel. He's said to faithfully honor his oath to protect them.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_4|He heard that the Koningur is thinking about hiring Kodan Ironsword to protect the coastal villages. I guess he figures it takes a pack of Vanskerry Raiders to beat another pack of them!
str_rumor_talk_kodan_5|He heard that if you want protection from the Vanskerry Raiders, the Ironsword Company is what you need. That is nothing more than fighting fire with fire, in my opinion.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_6|He said that a pack of Vanskerries in the Ironsword Company damned near wrecked the Valonbray tavern last week. Kodan Ironsword himself cannot control them when they drink.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_7|He said that he had heard of an Vanskerry warband calling themselves the Ironsword Company. Apparently it is led by Kodan Ironsword, who is said to be more ferocious than a rabid bear.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_8|He heard that the Koningur told some merchants who complained about the Ironsword Company just to pay off Kodan and shut up about it. At least, if they pay, their shipments will arrive.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_9|He heard that most of the Fierdsvain Lords walk most carefully around Kodan Ironsword. He is reputed to be very quick to take offense at a careless comment.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_10|He heard that fifty Vanskerry Raiders happened to see Kodan Ironsword's company headed towards them, and tripped over themselves getting back to their longboats.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_11|He said the Koningur is already regretting paying off Kodan Ironsword, because he has now demanded an increase in pay, and hinted that lack of compliance will prove very costly to the Fierdsvain.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_12|He heard that the Ironsword Company raided a fishing village and carried off every female there between the ages of twelve and twenty. I pity those poor girls from the bottom of my heart, indeed I do.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_13|He said that if you run across the Ironsword Company, smile and pay what Kodan demands. You will live longer that way.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_14|He said that he heard rumors about the amazing rune encrusted sword wielded by Kodan Ironsword, which can slice through armor like a hot knife through butter.
str_rumor_talk_kodan_15|He heard rumors that the Vanskerry raiders have united under a Jarl named Kodan Ironsword who has formed them up as an Adventure Company. Who would have thought that?
str_rumor_talk_syla_1|He has heard there is a new danger to watch out for in Sarleon, one Syla Uzas. He is reputed to kill just for the fun of it.
str_rumor_talk_syla_2|He said that Syla Uzas is the most dangerous Rogue Knight plaguing Sarleon these days. He kills without mercy, and laughs as he does it.
str_rumor_talk_syla_3|He says that rumor has it that Syla Uzas looted and burned an entire camp in the D'Shar Territories, because the peasants did not have sufficient supplies on hand to placate him.
str_rumor_talk_syla_4|He has heard that the wisest course to follow with Syla Uzas is to avoid him like the plague. He is very, very dangerous.
str_rumor_talk_syla_5|He said that a trader told him that Syla Uzas captured his caravan, killed all his guards and then left him stripped of even his clothes, to travel alone to the nearest town.
str_rumor_talk_syla_6|If what he says about Syla Uzas is true, I would greatly fear to meet him. He is reputed to be a complete sociopath without a shred of mercy in him.
str_rumor_talk_syla_7|He said that he heard from a trader from Avendor that Syla Uzas was at large near there, and all the villagers are screaming to their lords for protection from him.
str_rumor_talk_syla_8|He has heard tell that even Kodan Ironsword avoids a fight with that lot of murderers led by Syla Uzas. I cannot imagine what could frighten a man like Kodan, and I prefer not to!
str_rumor_talk_syla_9|He said that he was informed that even the Vanskerry Raiders run from Syla Uzas, because he has killed so many of their numbers.
str_rumor_talk_syla_10|He heard that Syla Uzas is so fearsome that he puts new meaning into the name 'Rogue Knight.' That is certainly saying something.
str_rumor_talk_syla_11|He said that he has heard that most people who see Syla Uzas coming immediately run the other way. He is utterly terrifying.
str_rumor_talk_syla_12|He has heard people say that Syla Uzas likes to cut his enemies into little pieces and toss them into the sea.
str_rumor_talk_syla_13|He said that he witnessed the legendary warrior, Syla Uzas, take on three rogue knights at once and defeat them all.
str_rumor_talk_syla_14|He has heard that Syla Uzas is gathering knights to overthrow King Ulric of Sarleon. 
str_rumor_talk_syla_15|He has heard tell of a rogue knight named Syla Uzas who is both ruthless and entirely merciless in his quest for power and fame.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_1|He heard tell that a D'Shar Sheik was outlawed and is assembling an army of outlaw raiders on the D'Shar plains.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_2|He heard about the latest D'Shar blood feud. Some sheik or other was outlawed by the Bahadur Khan, and has sworn revenge against him.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_3|He heard that some D'Shar Sheik, Slaverer, or something like that, has begun to unite the D'Shar Outlaw Raiders against the Bahadur Khan.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_4|He said he heard in Torbah that the Bahadur Khan beheaded a man for joking about Sheik Shalavan in his presence. I guess it was not a very good joke, ha ha.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_5|He heard that the D'Shar outlaws are far bolder now that they follow Sheik Shalavan. Many of the D'Shar settlements fear them.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_6|He said that some D'Shar bandit has christened himself a 'Sheik' and has begun building an army out of the rabble in the D'Shar Territories
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_7|He heard the Bahadur Khan sits uneasily on his throne, because some D'Shar rebel called Shalavan has sworn to take it from him.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_8|He said that one of the D'Shar horse merchants was in here the other day, and said that he almost lost his string on the way, to some raiders led by some bandit sheik or other.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_9|He heard on the grapevine that the D'Shar Khans may stop fighting amongst themselves long enough to mount a campaign against Sheik Shalavan. I doubt their truce will last very long.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_10|He heard in Nal Tar that Rafiq Bey was accosted by Sheik Shalavan, who demanded that he pay him tribute. That old tightwad would rather die than spend his gold, so I doubt he forked over a single denar.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_11|He said that word is that caravans to the D'Shar territories need an army as escort, else they never reach their destinations. Some sheik has taken to robbing every one that passes.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_12|He said that if gossip does not lie, there's real trouble brewing in the D'Shar Territories. Some fellow called Sheik Shalavan has an army of D'Shar Raiders poised to try for the throne.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_13|He said that he has seen many defections among the various tribes' warriors to join this outlaw D'Shar Sheik called Shalavan.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_14|He said that many Torbah warriors have left the Bahadur Khan to embrace the old ways of desert raiders under the banner of Sheik Shalavan.
str_rumor_talk_shalavan_15|He said that Sheik Shalavan is recruiting Windriders from the various D'Shar tribes to overthrow Kadan Bahadur Khan.
str_rumor_talk_boris_1|He heard tell of an army of vicious knights, led by one Boris the Raven, as he is known. It is said their savagery in battle is unrivaled.
str_rumor_talk_boris_2|He said they wielded their morningstars so well that none could defeat them, and Boris the Raven is the strongest of them all! 
str_rumor_talk_boris_3|He heard from a knight that the only sane action, if you run across Boris the Raven, is to run like hell for your life. He does not take prisoners.
str_rumor_talk_boris_4|He said that Boris the Raven fancies himself the greatest knight in Pendor, and challenges everyone he meets. He always wins, too.
str_rumor_talk_boris_5|He said that a trader he knows witnessed the aftermath of a great battle between a Ravenstern Lord and Boris the Raven. The corpses lay thick on the ground 
str_rumor_talk_boris_6|He said that a knight of Senderfall told him that fighting Boris the Raven was an exercise in utter futility. An army twice the size of his cannot defeat him.
str_rumor_talk_boris_7|He said that Boris the Raven rarely takes prisoners, but prefers to kill the wounded after a battle. He says wounded prisoners are too much trouble to keep alive.
str_rumor_talk_boris_8|He informed me that an army, led by the infamous Boris the Raven, is now at large, ravaging the countryside. The Ravenstern Lords all fear him.
str_rumor_talk_boris_9|He heard that the King himself fears to tackle Boris the Raven, because he becomes stronger daily, and the King fears a humiliating defeat.
str_rumor_talk_boris_10|He heard from a traveling priest that Boris the Raven boasts that he will have Ravenstern first, then take all Pendor.
str_rumor_talk_boris_11|He talked to a trader who was in the tavern where Boris the Raven was entertaining his men. He said that Boris was looking to challenge someone named {playername}. Looks like you caught the attention of someone interesting.
str_rumor_talk_boris_12|He said that a tavernkeeper told him that Boris the Raven's favorite toast is 'To death, destruction and victory with no survivors.' He sounds very dangerous to me.
str_rumor_talk_boris_13|He heard rumors that Boris the Raven has eyes of two different colors, one black, the other light blue. He stands 7 feet tall and can break a man in half with ease.
str_rumor_talk_boris_14|He heard that Boris the Raven broke with the tradition of the Knights of the Raven Spear and now has created a schism in the Order. Dozens of those Knights have sworn allegiance to him!
str_rumor_talk_boris_15|He has heard that Boris the Raven and his Rogue Knights are the best in all of Pendor. They can take any castle with their siege crossbows and heavy armor!
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_1|He said the Noldor were fighting under a new warlord, name of Aeldarian, or something like that. The Noldor always mean trouble.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_2|He said that a trader told him about a Noldor Warlord, Aeldarian, who has no patience with human encroachments onto their turf.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_3|He said that one of the Empire Lords had a dust-up with the Noldor, and had the bad luck to run into Warlord Aeldarian. He was badly beaten.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_4|He has heard that the Noldor Aeldarian is reputed to hate the Jatu more than the other humans in Pendor. He shows them no mercy. 
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_5|He has heard that Noldor warlord, Aeldarian, won't ransom prisoners when he takes them. He forces his prisoners to join him or die.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_6|He came across two militiaman who said they chased some forest bandits into Noldor territory, but did not follow them. He figured Warlord Aeldarian would take care of them.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_7|He heard that one of the Noldor warlords despises humans and won't tolerate their presence in Noldor territory.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_8|He said that the traders no longer travel through the woods near Laria, because with Warlord Aelderian patrolling the woodlands, the Noldor have gotten extremely aggressive in defense of their territory.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_9|He said that rumor has it that Warlord Aeldarian laughs in glee each time one Pendor faction declares war on another. He would be happy if we all killed each other, if rumor does not lie.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_10|He heard from a wounded forest bandit that Warlord Aeldarian's warband killed forty of their number in the woods outside Laria. 
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_11|He said the Noldor, under Warlord Aeldarian, have been mixing it up with the Jatu again. If the story I heard is true, the Jatu had the worst of it.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_12|He said that if we travel through the woods outside Laria, take care. He has heard that the Noldor Warlord, Aeldarian challenges all who venture there.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_13|He has heard the Noldor are venturing more boldly into the Empire, these days, under the leadership of someone named Aeldarion. 
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_14|He has heard that Aeldarian, the famous Noldor Warlord, has a wonderous bow in his possession. Thunder echoes when he fires an arrow.
str_rumor_talk_aeldarian_15|He heard that the Noldor, led by the Warlord Aeldarian, are raiding the Jatu for their horses. I wonder why they want Jatu animals, when their own are so fast.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_1|He was told that Ithilrandir, the Noldor, is not as anti-human as most of his ilk.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_2|He heard from a bowman that he was released by Ithilrandir after his Lord lost a battle to him. Honor of that sort from a Noldor is rare.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_3|He heard the Noldor have another warlord, one Ithilrandir, who seems to be more tolerant towards our kind than most of his cohorts.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_4|He said that in the Empire, word is that Marius is grateful for the assistance provided by a Noldor Warlord, Ithilrandir, in the fight against the Snake Cult.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_5|He heard the King in Sarleon has backed off on fighting the Noldor, because they are fighting the Jatu, and that benefits us all.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_6|He heard that the Noldor Warlord, Ithilrandir, is a just and honorable man, if you can call a Noldor a 'man.' They really are not fully human at all.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_7|He said that a bard told him that the Noldor came from some island far from Pendor, that they themselves destroyed by magic, even though they have no real magic now.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_8|He said that word from Laria is that Ithilrandir, some Noldor warlord, has just about eliminated all the forest bandits in the Woods of Laria.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_9|He heard in Poinsbruk that a Noldor Warlord, Ithilrandir, chased a band of Jatu damned near to the Poinsbruk city gates.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_10|He heard that in the Empire, a lot of the villagers like the Noldor, and that Warlord Ithilrandir recruits in the villages there, when the Lords are not looking.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_11|He said that a Ranger told him that the Noldor Rangers are absolutely amazing. He claims their range and accuracy is uncanny.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_12|He heard that if you rescue Noldor prisoners and free them, that Ithilrandir will reward you with unchallenged passage through the Woods of Laria.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_13|He said that the Noldor look down on humans because they think us no better than uncivilized animals. They think mighty well of themselves, they do.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_14|He said that he has seen the Noldor Warlord Ithilrandir draw his bow and slay a fully armored knight with a single arrow. Such news makes me uneasy.
str_rumor_talk_ithilrandir_15|He said that a Knight from Laria who challenged the Noldor Ithilrandir was cut in two with a single slash of his massive two-handed sword. I did not know that such a feat was even possible.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_1|He said that a wounded knight told him a terrifying tale of creatures whose faces resembled rotten meat, led by a fearsome creature called Eyegrim the Devourer.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_2|He said that a limping bandit told him his men had run across a hideous creature called Eyegrim the Devourer. He barely escaped with his life, and more than thirty of his mates were slain. Their horrible screams could be heard for miles.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_3|He said that a troubadour told him that the army of Eyegrim the Devourer eats the corpses of their slain foes. Eyegrim is said to pull the hearts from still-living captives because he prefers his meat fresh.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_4|He heard from a healer that it is almost impossible to heal wounds inflicted by Eyegrim the Devourer. He coats his weapons in poisonous filth that causes the wounds to rot.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_5|He heard that the Snake Cult Priestesses fear Eyegrimm the Devourer, for his followers can best even their Anaconda Knights.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_6|He heard that a fearsome army of undead, led by one Eyegrim the Devourer, has invaded Pendor. As if we do not have trouble enough here already.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_7|He heard that the peasants in the Fierdsvain guard their graveyards now, for fear that Eyegrim the Devourer will raise their dead for his army.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_8|He encountered a trader who came across a knight missing one arm, dying where he lay. He told the trader that Eyegrim the Devourer had torn off his arm and eaten it before his very eyes.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_9|He heard that a D'Shar Khan is rumored to thank his god, Vata, daily that his horse was fleet enough to outrun Eyegrim the Devourer. His warband perished defending his retreat.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_10|He said that rumors tell of a D'Shar tribal camp overrun by Eyegrim the Devourer and his army. It stands empty now because Eyegrim and his army ate every last man, woman and child in it, some while they were still alive.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_11|He said that even the Bahadur Khan himself pisses his armor in fear, when he has word that Eyegrim the Devourer is in D'Shar territory. 
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_12|He heard rumors that Eyegrim the Devourer had boasted that he looked forward to meeting someone called {playername}, because he fancied eating the still-beating hearts of brave warriors.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_13|He heard some nobles curse those Heretics to a fiery eternity for summoning the unstoppable Eyegrim the Devourer.
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_14|He heard that the Heretics were trying to summon a very strong demon called Eyegrim the Devourer to this world. Gods help us if they are successful!
str_rumor_talk_eyegrim_15|He said that he met a Heretic Confessor, alone and clearly frightened, racing for the mountains to escape the Heretic priests' nefarious plans. The Confessor was unaware of their plan initially, but once he heard of it, deserted to save not only his life but his very soul!
str_rumor_talk_dread_1|He said that a trader came across a dying Legionnaire, whose last words were of a fearsome Legion, led by the Snake Cult, so large he could not count their numbers.
str_rumor_talk_dread_2|He has heard it rumored in the Empire that even Marius, with all his army, fears to tackle the Dread Legion, for they cannot be defeated. The Empire may yet fall to the Snake Cult, if this story is true.
str_rumor_talk_dread_3|He was told in the Empire that the Snake Cult has invaded Pendor with an army too large to defeat. They are capturing everyone who crosses their path, for sacrifice to their hideous goddess.
str_rumor_talk_dread_4|He has heard some people say that the Dread Legion is really the elite Third Legion the old Empire once sent to defeat the Snake Cult uprising, but were never heard from again.
str_rumor_talk_dread_5|He said that the Anaconda Knights of the Dread Legion are five times stronger than any knight in Pendor, and no one can stand against them 
str_rumor_talk_dread_6|He was traveling in the Empire last week, and an Empire Horseman fleeing the Dread Legion told him to run for his life because there was no point in standing against their evil numbers.'
str_rumor_talk_dread_7|He heard that the kiss of a Snake Cult Priestess brings instant death. They are said to imbibe poison from childhood onward, as part of their revolting rites. Their very breath can slay a man, or so he was told.
str_rumor_talk_dread_8|He bumped into a fellow from Janos the other day. The man told him that the Snake Cult Priestesses are taken from Empire villages as young girls, and trained up from childhood to kill. The snake venom they feed them perverts their minds to unthinking devotion to their goddess.
str_rumor_talk_dread_9|He said that someone whispered to him that the Dread Legion seeks one {playername}, to avenge the Snake Cultists slain by {reg63?his:her} warband. It is said that {reg63?he:she} is to be taken alive and delivered to their goddess for a terrible punishment. You've made some powerful enemies there.
str_rumor_talk_dread_10|He said that he inadvertently overheard a conversation in the Cez tavern about a huge army, the Dread Legion, which has invaded the Empire. All who encounter them are slain or taken captive.
str_rumor_talk_dread_11|He said that it is rumored in the Empire that a Dread Legion, composed of numerous Snake Cultists, fights under the aegis of Azi Dahaka, their terrifying goddess, whose power makes them invincible.
str_rumor_talk_dread_12|He has heard that in the Empire the goddess of the Snake Cult, Azi Dahaka, takes the form of a huge hooded cobra and directs her Dread Legion in their slaughter.
str_rumor_talk_dread_13|I'm not sure I believe this tale, but he said that there is talk in the Empire of an invading army called the Dread Legion, filled with Snake Cult Priestesses and their Anaconda Knights.
str_rumor_talk_dread_14|He said that he heard rumors that the Dread Legion used to be the Imperial Guard of the old Baccus Empire, before their souls were consumed by the Snake Goddess prior to the collapse of the Empire.
str_rumor_talk_dread_15|He has heard that the snake priestesses are talking of the arrival of the Dread Legion, the unstoppable army of the Snake Cult's unholy mother.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_1|He said that a friend of his spotted three women dressed for battle on swift warhorses. They were riding near Marleons at full gallop.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_2|He said that a knight told him that he narrowly escaped being seduced by the sweet words of three beautiful women commanding and army. He managed to escape, but two of his friends were trapped into serving in the ranks of the Three Seers.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_3|He said that a Fierdsvain farmer in the market told him that he had seen a huge army, composed mostly of women, riding past Mistmire Castle before dawn last week.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_4|He said that the chief steward of the Koningur was in the Javiksholm tavern dead drunk the other night. He said that his Koningur prays to Thallo that those Seer-women will stay in Sarleon so he does not have to take action against them. He is not sure he can defeat an army that large.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_5|He said that he heard tell of a merchant house of 'Felin' that was having shady dealings with the Red Brotherhood. Their thuggery will certainly cause the nobility of Sarleon to turn against them soon.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_6|He said that the order of the Red Fletchers held an archery tournament in Avendor, and a Ravenstern chap put them all to shame.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_7|He said the knighthood order of the Boar were sponsoring their annual hunt. That hunt has been going on every year for over 20 summers.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_8|He told me some rumors about a minor Sarleon noble house of 'Morgan' that have been at odds with King Ulric for some time. There is no love lost between them.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_9|I have no idea what a 'Doomguide' might be, but he said that several of them were in the area the other night. They were armed to the teeth, and were asking questions about Nobles in the area.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_10|He said that he was accosted by two women calling themselves 'Doomguides,' asking if he had seen a renegade Knight. That is odd, I think.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_11|He said that he heard about an army of women led by three seers who encountered the Sarleon Knighthood order of the Owl. They apparently met for tea in an open field then afterwards the Knights just rode away. Good thing, the knights were outnumbered over 20 to 1, so perhaps discretion is indeed the better part of valor.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_12|Our problems in Pendor never cease. He said that some pack of crazy females, calling themselves 'Seers,' has raised a monstrous army. They enslave the unwary... be careful if you run into them.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_13|It is rumored that in the swamps north of Mistmire Castle, three ancient and powerful Sorceresses have a hidden lair. He hears they trick the unwary into becoming their slaves.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_14|He ran across a half-starved warrior just outside of Avendor. The man raved about escaping his demonic lover in the swamps north of Mistmire. He thought the warrior mad until he exhibited the hand of a guard he had overpowered to escape. The hand he showed as proof of his escape was not entirely human.
str_rumor_talk_sisters3_15|He said the villagers near Mistmire fear and avoid the marshes near the castle because something very evil is lurking there.
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_1|He has heard there is a devoted sect of holymen who are purging the lands of heathens, with a leader no-less!
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor2|He said that Rasmus Devatica shows no mercy to the people in D'Shar lands, that no one is safe in the south!
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_3|He says that rumor has it that men of the Inquisition burned an entire camp in the D'Shar Territories, because they found one heretic amongst the peasants.
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_4|He has heard that the wisest course to follow when encountering Holy Inquisitor Rasmus is to flea from his merciless visage.
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_5|He said that a trader told him that Inquisitor Rasmus captured his caravan, stole his goods, and left him there stark naked, all because The Inquisition was in need of donations for 'the cause.'
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_6|If what he says about Rasmus Devatica is true, he and his holy order will find a reason to purge you from this world. He sees the heretic within us all.
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_7|He said that he heard from a trader from Torbah that Inquisitor Devatica was at large near there, and all the villages calling for their lords for protection from him.
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_8|He has heard tell that even Sheik Shalavan avoids a fight with that lot of murderers led by this 'holy' inquisitor. I cannot imagine what could frighten a man like Shalavan, and I prefer not to!
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_9|He said that he was informed that even the Eventide Knights dare not attack Rasmus. That they fear what happens if they survive well-enough to be captured..
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_10|He heard that no one expects the Holy Inquisition.
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_11|He said that he has heard that if Eyegrim and Rasmus we're to compete in a staring contest, Eyegrim would explode of holy fire!
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_12|He has heard people say that Devatica himself likes to interrogate heretics. Who knows behind closed doors?
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_13|He said that he witnessed the legendary inquisitor, Rasmus Devatica, take on three Heretic Invokers at once and defeat them all.
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_14|He has heard that Inquisitor Rasmus is gathering priests and mercenaries to fight with heretics and heathens.
str_rumor_talk_inquisitor_15|He has heard tell of an inquisitor named Rasmus Devatica, who is merciless in his quest for converting heretics.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_1|he heard a young man proselytizing on a street corner: 'There is a secret war in Pendor! What we mistake for Heretics are actually the crusaders of Eventide! They are here to liberate us from the tyranny of kings and priests! We can be free men again! Glorious beneath the eyes of our Goddess!' Yet, even as he said these things, the crowd stoned him.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_2|he heard from a woodsman outside Sarleon that the Heretics are not alone. It seems they're guided by an order of fierce knights who can slaughter militia with unparalleled ease. While hiding in the woods, he saw them butcher a platoon of halberdiers. As the sun set, he heard unsatiated bloodlust in their cries of victory.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_3|he heard from an Ehlerdah peasant that Baron Gaidon's father is still alive, but has become a recluse. Apparently, he never leaves his manor and only allows one trusted valet to attend him. Nobody is supposed to talk about it, but the whole village knows. His arms and legs were torn off, and now he mutters all day, terrified, 'Eventide, Eventide.'
str_rumor_talk_eventide_4|he heard a Heretic yelling from the stake, 'Erida will welcome me in my next life! The fire at my feet is the warmth of her touch! I will know the pleasure of her embrace, while you in Pendor suffer! Verily, all Pendor shall suffer! The Circle of Thorns is upon your head! Erida's twilight descends upon this benighted land, and Eventide shall wash you away!
str_rumor_talk_eventide_5|he heard from a man-at-arms that the Heretics' leaders come from Barclay, across the sea. This tidbit came from two knights, each adorned in splendid armor with a sunrise insignia. They had also sailed from Barclay, sent to hunt the Heretics' leaders. They call themselves The Knights of Dawn and they also seek the rebels of Eventide.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_6|he spoke with a thin young woman who once tended the tavern outside Foxstead. One night--just as the sun was setting--three black-clad knights sauntered in. The patrons fell dead quiet, averting their eyes. 'Give us thirteen barrels!' one of the knights shouted. When the barkeep protested that he did not have so much ale, they slaughtered all the patrons and and drained the dead men's mugs before vanishing into the night.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_7|he encountered a vagrant huddled in an alleyway. 'They're watching me, sirrah! Everywhere, their eyes are everywhere! They watch me through the crows, through the bats, through the wolves! Eventide is here, sirrah! Eventide has come to Pendor!
str_rumor_talk_eventide_8|he heard from a vegetable vendor that beets are becoming a scarce commodity. Ever since the Heretics took a fancy to them, the rest of Pendor has been hard pressed to keep the roots guarded. Nobody knows what those fanatics are planning, but it's been suggested that the beets' red juice resembles blood... and their guardians, The Knights of Eventide, savor every drop of it.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_9|he heard from a caravan guard that Pendor is under siege, not from a foreign military, but from an outlaw band of knights. They work in tandem with The Heretics. On his last trip, his caravan visited three villages laid to waste by these self-proclaimed Knights of Eventide.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_10|he heard from a Ravenstern Ranger that The Knights of Eventide have powerful witchcraft at their disposal. He emptied his full quiver into one of the knights, more arrows protruding from his back than quills from a porcupine, and still the monster rode on, slaughtering the men of Ravenstern with unflinching ease.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_11|he heard from a wild-eyed peasant that The Knights of Eventide breathe the night as the living breathe the air. It is their essence, their soul. And when they whisper their horrible thoughts, it comes out not as warm breath, but as a chill breeze of death.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_12|he heard from a red-eyed miller that he hadn't slept in thirteen days, and if he could help it, he would never sleep again. He no longer trusted the night. It was THEIR time. It was the hour of Eventide.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_13|he overheard soldiers at Poinsbruk saying that their latest shipment of weapons is six days late. Their quartermaster fears the worst:  The Knights of Eventide have intercepted yet another arms caravan.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_14|he heard a peasant boy weeping that his parents haven't returned in four nights. The other villagers suspect they've been abducted by Eventide, either to be sacrificed or forcibly converted.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_15|he heard a Ravenstern ranger say that now even wolves fear the approach of night. That has become the hour of Eventide.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_16|he heard that arms merchants have doubled--and in some cases tripled--the number of guards they bring with them. Rumor has it that the Knights of Eventide are gearing up for a major campaign, and they need weapons.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_17|he heard that some clever bandits have begun to wear crude imitations of Eventide armor. Apparently, that's all they need to frighten merchants into submission.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_18|he heard from a scholar in Ethos that the Knights of Eventide have more in common with the Order of Dawn than either will admit... She believes they may even be working together, one terrifying the people of Pendor so that the other can justify its growing tyranny.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_19|he heard from a woodmen in Sarleon that late at night, the Knights of Eventide will howl at the moon, and the most ferocious of them will actually take on the visage of wolves. He even saw them eat the flesh of another human being.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_20|he heard from fletcher in Janos that the leader of the Knights of Eventide has sold his humanity to gain immortality. Now, in order to survive, he must eat the souls of virgins, but only when the moon is full or when summer turns to fall.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_21|he heard from a wounded swordsman that he once worked for the Knights of Eventide, but when he saw their leader Kadrin drinking blood on the battlefield, he slipped away and never returned. Now, whenever he hears a bat squeak, he fears his life is about to end.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_22|he heard from a captured Heretic that the Knights of Eventide will rescue him, and that those who stand in the way of Erida Occisor will die. Three days later, a prison guard stabbed the other guards in the back, slaughtered every prisoner in the keep and then slit his own throat.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_23|he said a poor peasant told him of the destruction wrought on his village by a band of Knights of Eventide. Or was it the Knights of Dawn? I forget.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_24|he said that the Knights of Eventide are nothing more than closet Heretics posing as a knightly order.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_25|he said he once knew a Knight of Dawn, but the man switched Orders and is now a Knight of Eventide due to some kind of ideological differences.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_26|he said Sir John, a Sarleon Knight, claims that a Knight of Eventide is just a Knight of Dawn who has given up all pretense of being virtuous.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_27|he said that an Empire Legionnaire told him that the Demon warriors are child's play to fight compared to the Knights of Eventide.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_28|he said a Ravenstern Knight said that the Order of Dawn embraced their twisted path of zealotry in reaction to the heresy of the Knights of Eventide. He also said they are proud of their fanaticism.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_29|he said it is the dream of most Heretics to join the Order of the Knights of Eventide.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_30|he said the scholar, Martin Stryker, wrote in 'Justice or Injustice, a story of the Rising Sun' that Sir Godfroi was burned for heretical research into Erida Occisor. He also noted that Godfroi's death caused the Order to split into the factions of Dawn and Eventide.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_31|he said that the real reason the Knights of Eventide left the Order of Dawn was that vow of Chastity. Don't blame them either!
str_rumor_talk_eventide_32|he said a female friend of his had fallen in love with Sir Alistair, that villainous Knight of Eventide. I wonder why the ladies always prefer the bad ones!
str_rumor_talk_eventide_33|he heard a speech by a Knight of Eventide, it sounded like this, 'something something something... Dark Side.'
str_rumor_talk_eventide_34|he heard it said that when the first Knight of Eventide was burned for heresy he was heard to shout 'And thus the first sacrifice is made'. Ironic that it was the Knights of Dawn who burned him.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_35|he said that there were posters out offering a reward for the apprehension of some knight called Sir Roland. Apparently, both the Orders of Dawn, and Eventide want him dead. He must be a truly evil man.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_36|he knew a traveller from Barclay, who claimed that things were bad in Barclay. Caravans and villages just disappear off the face of the earth, and people sometimes stumble upon gruesome scenes of sacrifice. He described piles of skulls, bones circling a pit of entrails, and the overpowering stench of blood and burning flesh.
str_rumor_talk_eventide_37|he asked what was more forgivable, killing innocents because of your beliefs, or killing innocents because of their beliefs? This is at the root of the war between the Orders of Dawn and Eventide.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_1|he heard from the Valonbray armorer that a new order of knights moved into his city, knights who refuse to patronize any of the local smiths. Apparently they brought their own craftsmen from across the sea, and these men forge-- even he admits--the finest swords and armor Pendor has ever seen. That armor is emblazoned with a rising sun, so keep your eyes peeled.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_2|he heard that the Fierdsvain nobles are in an uproar over some new knighthood order. They sailed into Valonbray a few years back and have been stirring up trouble ever since. Apparently, they came to Pendor to kill Heretics, which is all fine and good, except they've been burning entire villages in the process. They even killed Lord Oakshield's son for interfering!
str_rumor_talk_dawn_3|he spoke with a merchant who nearly lost his life to the Heretics. They had been slowly torturing the man, smiling at his shrieks of agony. As his vision faded, the ground began to tremble and heavy horses galloped forth from the dawn, sweeping the Heretics away as the sun swept away the night's shadows.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_4|he heard from a wandering swordsman that there is a new order of knights in Pendor. Unlike the boisterous warriors he drinks with, these knights are as stern and quiet as death itself. He saw one get in a scrape once, and when the dust settled, seven of his assailants lay in puddles of blood. The knight walked away, unscathed but for the blood spattered across his shield, obscuring its sunrise insignia.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_5|It seems that Earl Aedin Redsword has reached an agreement with the self proclaimed Queen Agnus of the Vanskerry! Her Freebooters are sworn to his service!
str_rumor_talk_dawn_6|he heard from a drunken fishmonger that one should never take Astraea's name in vain. If they hear of it, the Order of Dawn will abduct your son as penance, putting him to work in their stables. Worst of all, the boy will end up as fanatical as his masters.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_7|he heard from the Javiksholm goods merchant--a fellow known to crack a good joke--that The Knights of the Dawn are the most humorless bastards in Pendor. They even threatened to confiscate his goods if he did not shut up.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_8|he heard a potato farmer say that his son was beheaded by a Knight of Dawn for failing to bow before the Order's grandmaster, Dalon Valchance.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_9|he overheard a Heretic say to his captors, 'You're with the Order of Dawn, yes? Then we're not so different, you and I. We both want to see a goddess return to this world, no matter what the cost.'  In response, the knights beat him bloody.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_10|he heard from a woodcutter outside Sarleon that even though he's a devout worshiper of Eunomia Stabilitis, he pretends to follow Astraea, instead--just to keep the Order of Dawn from coming after him.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_11|he heard from a pearl-diver in Valonbray that his wife was burned at the stake by the Order of Dawn. They suspected she was a heretic, tortured her, then stood her before a tribunal of monks, who forced her to admit to sins she had never committed. They then burned her.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_12|he heard from a squire in Sarleon that the Knights of Dawn can out-maneuver even King Ulric's personal bodyguard.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_13|he heard from an outspoken peasant that Bryn of Ravenstern could single-handedly rid her nation of the Order of Dawn, but she'd rather not fight until her son is full grown. When he heard this, he told the peasant not to spread such dangerous rumors, as the Order of Dawn might put Bryn before an Inquisition if they hear the rumors.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_14|he heard from a linen trader that the Order of Dawn has begun inspecting all goods that pass through Valenbray. Rumor has it that the Heretics have begun smuggling weapons to their brethren in Barclay.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_15|he met a pikeman with a story to tell. He narrowly escaped a raid by the Knights of Eventide and in hiding, watched his comrades die. When the Order of Dawn rode over the horizon, he thought they were saved. Not so. The Knights of Dawn vanquished their adversaries, then butchered his friends... just in case one was a Heretic in disguise.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_16|he heard from a Barclay diplomat that the Knights of Dawn were once a noble order, but in the past century became corrupted by their own virtue. Now, the nobility of his nation were simply eager to be rid of them, so sent them on a 'mission' to Pendor to be rid of them.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_17|he heard from a harlot in Valonbray that business has gotten significantly worse since the Order of Dawn established itself in town. She had expected the new knights would be eager for her company, but they spurn her propositions as if she had the plague.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_18|he heard from a barkeep in Valonbray that the Knights of Dawn come into his establishment often for the dartboard, but never actually buy a drink. The one time a knight did, the fool got drunk off three pints and started smashing the place up. A few days later, the poor sod was expelled from his order and subsequently found dead by his own hand.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_19|he heard a Knight of Dawn say that before long Astraea will come to Pendor and cleanse it of its sins via the Knights of Dawn. His own family was slaughtered by bandits, but in a world governed by Astraea, villains like that will burn before they can ever take up a sword.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_20|he said a Mettenheim Greatswordsman told him that the Knights of Dawn are the true power in Barclay.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_21|he said a Knight of the Radiant Cross told him their former allies, the Knights of Dawn, were guilty of many crimes. He witnessed their burning of a village after they slaughtered all the peasants there.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_22|he said a friend told him there is little difference between the Knights of Dawn and Eventide. Both Orders are composed of religion-addled, murderous bastards. Interestingly, his friend went missing soon after.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_23|he said rumor held there was a mysterious third faction involved in the dispute between the Knights of Dawn and the Knights of Eventide, though he knew nothing of this third group.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_24|he said a fisherman told him the Knights of Dawn requisitioned his fishing boat to transport troops and weaponry from Barclay. He never saw a denar in return from those bloody thieves.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_25|he said a local barman told him that the Knights of Dawn and Eventide were once both the same Order. The Order of Pink Pansies.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_26|he said a priest of Astraea told him that the Order of Dawn and Eventide were once as one, but both had forsaken their true purposes.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_27|he said that even the purest can be corrupted, witness the current state of those Knights of Dawn.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_28|he said a wandering minstrel told him of a village ravaged by the Knights of Dawn. Not one peasant survived.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_29|he said he asked him, which is worse: A brigand murdering to keep his children fed, or a knight killing innocents in the name of 'justice'?
str_rumor_talk_dawn_30|he said he once met a very gracious Knight named Roland. He was true paragon of what the Knights of Dawn once stood for. Sir Roland said he'd left the Order of Dawn. Now, they've put a price on his head for desertion and theft of his equipment and horse.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_31|he said a Ravenstern Ranger told him a Knight of Dawn seized his bow and broke it, claiming it was the god, UllrVetr, manifested. The ranger killed the knight, ambushed him from cover with his new bow!
str_rumor_talk_dawn_32|he said a Knight of the Raven Spear told a great joke; two Knights, one of the Radiant Cross and one of the Dawn plus a Huscarl meet in a tavern. The Radiant Cross knight first orders a bottle of wine... for medicinal purposes. The Huscarl then buys a strong rum, and immediately challenges all those present to a drinking contest. Finally, the Knight of Dawn steps up and buys the entire stock of whiskey. He then dumped it over the heads of the other two, set it aflame and walked out of the tavern laughing.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_33|he said a D'Shar tribesman once described a Fierdsvain clansman with a 'fiery beard'. Unfortunately, a Knight of Dawn overheard and misunderstood. He immediately began slaughtering nearby Fierdsvainers to purge them of their heretical practice of sacrificing their beards to the gods of Flame.
str_rumor_talk_dawn_34|he said a Knight of the Dawn once reprimanded a friend of his for laughing, saying that mirth was a heretical sin.
str_rumor_talk_mett_1|he said a Barclay sailor told him that Mettenheim has great ships of iron powered by magic. They call them 'Ironclads.'
str_rumor_talk_mett_2|he said an Empire legionnaire told him Mettenheim soldiers are so strong they wield their greatswords like mere twigs.
str_rumor_talk_mett_3|he was told that Mettenheim soldiers refuse to use horses, as their faces remind them too much of their wives.
str_rumor_talk_mett_4|he heard a Sarleon priest say that the people of Mettenheim esteem iron almost as if it were a god.
str_rumor_talk_mett_5|he said he once spoke to a Mettenheim soldier. That's about it really.
str_rumor_talk_mett_6|he said he was working in the city prison. A captured Snake cultist told him about an odd Mettenheim warcry; apparently they shout 'I'll be back' when they have to retreat.
str_rumor_talk_mett_7|he heard that even the Noldor are in awe of Mettenheim metallurgy.
str_rumor_talk_mett_8|he said a historian told him the Mettenheim sovereign drops all former titles and loyalties. Even his name is changed to 'The Count'. Some of the other kings could learn from this dedication.
str_rumor_talk_mett_9|he said a prosperous trader told him he only sells his farm produce to Mettenheim. They pay much more because of the massive famine in their homeland.
str_rumor_talk_mett_10|he heard that, although they are presently at peace, a war between Barclay and Mettenheim is as likely as tomorrow's dawn.
str_rumor_talk_mett_11|he said a young Mettenheim soldier told him of his dream to join the Forlorn Hope, their most prestigious Order.
str_rumor_talk_mett_12|he heard a Mettenheim merchant say the Forlorn Hope is a suicidal group. Only those older men of declining strength may join, due to having less to live for than the younger men.
str_rumor_talk_mett_13|he was told a Fierdsvain fisherman went looking for the Mettenheim homeland, but found only a massive volcano in the middle of the sea.
str_rumor_talk_mett_14|he heard a rumor that an Empire prefect has suggested Mettenheim is in league with the Snake Cult. Odd, since the Snakes massacred the lot of them when they were shipwrecked, or so I heard.
str_rumor_talk_mett_15|he heard a retired mercenary say that a Mettenheim column has sufficient strength and stamina to keep pace with a unit of heavy cavalry on the march.
str_rumor_talk_mett_16|he said a Fierdsvain berserker told him he has respect for Mettenheim troops  they are the only ones able to match him drink for drink.
str_rumor_talk_mett_17|he heard from a D'Shar herder of a man called Frederick. Said he defeated a Jatu raiding party by killing the horses beneath them, a novel means of combat for the D'Shar who usually take the mounts as a prize.
str_rumor_talk_ogma_1|he heard that Lord Olaf Oakshield had married a famous Valkyrie many years ago. According to legend she was the only person who could beat him in his prime. Unfortunately, she died while giving birth to their daughter, Ogma. Not long after, he lost his son, as well. Death seems to follow that poor man...
str_rumor_talk_ogma_2|he heard from the Valonbray jeweler that Lord Oakshield has been spending an unseemly amount on jewelry for his daughter, Ogma. The jeweler almost regretted driving a lord into poverty but, at the same time, how could he refuse such lucrative business?
str_rumor_talk_ogma_3|he heard from Lady Ogma's maid-in-waiting that the lady's father, Lord Olaf Oakshield, dotes on her, buying the most extravagant dresses and jewelery in Pendor. Although most maidens would be thrilled by these gifts, Lady Ogma only thanks her father politely. Truly, she would rather lead a troop of cavalry, dressed in her mother's Valkyrie armor.
str_rumor_talk_ogma_4|he heard from Lady Ogma's maid-in-waiting that the young lady sneaks away at night. She thought she was hiding a clandestine love-affair, but when Ogma returned with a nasty gash on her arm, the truth came out. 'I've hired a swordsman to train me in the martial arts. Please, Lola, don't let my father know of this. He would go grey with worry.'
str_rumor_talk_ogma_5|he heard from the stablehand that the finest horse in Valonbray belongs to Lady Ogma. The mare is a spirit horse, captured from a Noldor lord. Nobody in Valonbray could ride her, yet Lady Ogma--who'd never ridden a warhorse before--didn't care. Everyone thought she'd break her neck. However, a few weeks later, she rode in on the mare, as serene as Astraea herself.
str_rumor_talk_ogma_6|he heard from Lady Ogma's maid that the young lady keeps her mother's armor on the wall and polishes it while her maids knit and sew. Before marrying Lord Olaf Oakshield, Ogma's mother had been a Valkyrie.  Ogma wishes to be one as well, but her father strictly forbids it. He lost both his son and his wife, and cannot bear the thought of losing his daughter as well.
str_rumor_talk_halz_1|he heard stories about an ambitious man named Halstein. They say he studied under some of the greatest minds to became a scholar. After he learned all he could, he left that path to became the head of his family. That's how he became both rich and politically influential.
str_rumor_talk_halz_2|he said that despite his intelligence and wisdom, Halstein, that new merchant-prince from Fierdsvain is very proud and ambitious. People say a fire burns in his eyes.
str_rumor_talk_halz_3|he was told never to provoke a man named Halstein, because he is a mastermind unlike any other. Don't let his young and handsome appearance fool you -- he is dangerous.
str_rumor_talk_halz_4|he heard that Halstein's influence is spreading; lords consult him because of his sharp mind and grasp of tactics. They also attribute several of the Fierdsvain's latest victories to Halstein's planning.
str_rumor_talk_halz_5|he heard that Halstein lost his temper and struck a man, when he said that Hormuzd of the D'Shar might have a better mind than his.
str_rumor_talk_halz_6|he was told that Halstein is looking for a wife, but it appears he cannot find a woman to suit him. He is looking for specific characteristics, what he doesn't specify, saying only that he seeks a woman whose fiery eyes shine with intelligence.
str_rumor_talk_edytha_1|he heard in Sarleon that Lady Edytha's popularity at court is unmatched. Though she comes from minor nobility, she has charmed and finagled her way into the inner circles of noble society. Nobody dares to bring up her lineage these days. The last court lady who did so was ostracized for her insolence.
str_rumor_talk_edytha_2|he heard from a seamstress in Sarleon that Lady Edytha cannot afford to buy fine gowns, but must depend upon the generosity of her suitors. Rumor has it that her father has squandered much of the family estate with his gambling.
str_rumor_talk_edytha_3|he overheard two young lords in Sarleon boasting about the affections of Lady Edytha. One claimed she graced him with a smile, while the other said she had batted her lashes at him. Their voices continued rising, until ultimately\ their conversation became a yelling match in the middle of the street. They drew their swords and both spilt blood on the cobblestones.
str_rumor_talk_edytha_4|he heard from a peasant in Burglen that Lord Andre's gambling habit is beginning to affect the village. He can no longer afford to maintain the village mill, and the farmers worry he won't be able to pay his soldiers' wages. His daughter Edytha abandoned the estate in disgust. She guests with  friends in the capital, seeking a husband before her family's disgrace destroys her chances of a decent marriage.
str_rumor_talk_edytha_5|he overheard Lady Edytha say to a weeping maiden, 'You once thought yourself  my superior, did you not? Your father owns a castle, while mine holds only a village. You looked down upon me and treated me like a serf. Now you find that for all your supposed status, you are my inferior. Yes, Merydth, I am smarter, stronger, and more beautiful than you. You are my serf now! Beg for mercy; I may grant it.'
str_rumor_talk_edytha_6|he heard that Lady Edytha controls the inner circle of Sarleon society with unprecedented ferocity. To lords and warriors, she appears sweet and charming, but to her rivals, she is utterly ruthless. She has reduced ladies of the highest nobility to submission. They will do anything to please her and become her confidant. Surely, she is destined to marry a great man.
str_rumor_talk_kenric_1|he said that a young knight named Kenric has been winning numerous jousts these days and that few can match him. Many ladies are talking about him.
str_rumor_talk_kenric_2|he was told Kenric, a young knight of Sarleon, is the subject of much talk. Some people have high hopes of him, due to his pride, idealism and faith in the king. Others say he is just a dreamy and gullible youth who jousts well.
str_rumor_talk_kenric_3|he heard that talk of young Kenric in the Sarleon court had already caused arguments amongst the nobles. Apparently, Kenric gets furious with anyone who voices criticism of the king's actions.
str_rumor_talk_kenric_4|he heard that there are many ladies hoping for the hand of some Sarleon knight named Kenric. They say he not only is quite handsome but also a skilled knight, despite the fact that he has not fought in a battle, only won tournaments.
str_rumor_talk_kenric_5|he was told that Kenric once said that he believes that change comes about from the inside out. First a man should strive to change what he can in his own life, before taking dramatic actions to change others.
str_rumor_talk_kenric_6|he was told that Kenric is wild with eagerness to try his strength on a battlefield, but his family holds him back. Perhaps it is because they prefer to find him a good marriage or it might be that they fear his boldness will lead to his death. All Kenric talks of is his wish to join a battle.
str_rumor_talk_hamida_1|he heard from a rug merchant in Nal Tar that D'Shar women are the finest weavers in Pendor. Many merchants have grown rich selling D'Shar rugs, and none less so than Hamida of the D'Shar. She has shown incredible marketing skill, and forged a highly lucrative trading route between Pendor and Barclay. She exports handwoven D'Shar carpets to Barclay and returns with exquisite paintings from the Barclay artists.
str_rumor_talk_hamida_2|he heard a bard praise the graces of Hamida, the Flower of Nal Tar. She is said to embody the beauty of the desert, and is voluptuous and golden as saffron. She is quiet and self-contained; men claim that merely to sit with her in her tent brings them peace. Countless men have fallen in love with her, but none have succeeded in plucking the Flower of Nal Tar.
str_rumor_talk_hamida_3|he heard from an old maid in Nal Tar that the merchant Hamida trained as a poetess and showed great promise. Caliph Tahir praised her work, and may have promised her to his son. She defied D'Shar tradition at  of fourteen, kissed her parents farewell and began life as a traveling peddler. Her habit of speaking softly, coupled with her unfailing  honesty, gained the trust of her customers. These days, she makes more money than any five merchants in Pendor.
str_rumor_talk_hamida_4|he heard from a courtesan in Singal that although the lady Hamida is not technically of noble birth, her pleasant company and recent successes as a merchant have earned her regular invitations to court. She has rapidly become one of the most popular\ ladies at court, amongst both the nobility and the servants. Her warmth, courtesy and humility have made allies of even the surliest servingmen.
str_rumor_talk_hamida_5|he heard from a stable hand in Singal that gazing into the lady Hamida's eyes makes a man feel as warm as if he were basking in the sun on a sunny spring afternoon. Her warmth and kindness, which appear effortless, can be felt without a single word being uttered. She need do no more than smile.
str_rumor_talk_hamida_6|he heard from a sailor that when the merchant Hamida steps out of her cabin the whole ship's crew falls silent in awe of her beauty. On her voyages to Barclay, she spends long afternoons standing at the prow, silently staring out over the ocean. No one knows what she is thinking, but any sailor would lay down his life to aid her.
str_rumor_talk_hormz_1|he was told about a man of the D'Shar called Hormuzd, whom people say was a very successful lord, renowned in many battles. One day he supposedly left everything behind to became a virtual hermit, but now out of nowhere he has returned to the capital.
str_rumor_talk_hormz_2|he heard from servants that several D'Shar lords complained they were assaulted by strange questions from a wise man named Hormzud. No one in the D'Shar Principalites understands the reason for his questions.
str_rumor_talk_hormz_3|he heard stories of how Hormuzd, as a young prince, managed to defeat a large enemy force by driving them toward a dry field, then setting it afire. The smoke made the enemy too weak to fight and they were forced to retreat. Thus, he won his battle without wetting a single blade.
str_rumor_talk_hormz_4|he was told that there are no men as wise as Hormuzd. Since his return to court, he has been sharing his knowledge; people say that in only a few weeks he finished writing several books on philosophy, battle tactics and a treatise on ancient D'Shar poetry.
str_rumor_talk_hormz_5|he said there is a man in Kadan Bahadur Khan's court by the name of Hormuzd, who has introduced several new ideas to help the common people, especially guides on how to avoid food shortages or and the treatment of plagues.
str_rumor_talk_hormz_6|he was told that the reason Hormuzd left the Principalities was that one day, one of his brilliant ideas didn't worked as planned. He won a great battle, but due to a miscalculation or perhaps an accident, a man important to him died. He blamed himself so much that he left his whole life behind and became a hermit somewhere in the deep desert.
str_rumor_talk_hormz_7|he heard from ladies of the Kadan's court that they once asked Hormuzd why he was yet unmarried. He told them that he hadn't found a woman who could share his vision of the universe and would not marry until he found such a woman.
str_rumor_talk_lux_1|he heard from a scribe in Ethos that Justus Dux has only one daughter,  an exceedingly bright one. By the age of three, she was reading the epic poems of Baccus. Before she was six, she had translated seven runes in the Noldor script... a feat no adult has managed. She is now seventeen but still unmarried. The men of The Empire don't court her for fear of appearing foolish in her eyes. Her name is Luciana Dux. 
str_rumor_talk_lux_2|he heard from candlemakers in Ethos that Luciana, daughter of Justus Dux, has ordered so many candles from him that their price can feed his family for seven years. She sleeps little, preferring to spend her nights jotting notes, as she sifts through ancient manuscripts. She is rumored to be studying in depth the Prophecy of Madigan.
str_rumor_talk_lux_3|he heard from a guard in Cez that Luciana, daughter to Justus Dux, has no patience with those she deems fools. During a ball last year, Bionr Legatus was pontificating to his friends that the D'Shar descended from jackals, whereas the citizens of the Empire descended from the gods. She overheard his remark, pushed her way into their circle and started reciting an endless stream of historical facts. Her reluctant listeners slunk away one at a time, until she was left standing alone.
str_rumor_talk_lux_4|he heard from a scribe in Ethos that Luciana, daughter of Justus Dux stays up all night with her books. He is not sure when she sleeps, but apparently it is rarely. She sits alone in her study, burning dozens of candles all through the night, poring endlessly over ancient scrolls and manuscripts.
str_rumor_talk_lux_5|he heard from a scholar in Sarleon that philosophers from throughout Pendor travel to Ethos to visit a young prodigy named Luciana. She is famous for translating Noldor scrolls, even though the Noldor alphabet is hundreds of characters long and she only understands a few of them. Rumor holds that she freely offers her translation services to anyone who can bring her a text by the prophet Madigan, her new object of study.
str_rumor_talk_lux_6|he heard from a courtesan in Cez that Luciana, daughter to Justus Dux, is unofficially excluded from noble Empire society. They cannot prevent her from attending the Imperial Ball and other festivals, but her confrontational behavior has induced a dislike of her in most of her peers. She does not seem to mind, but spends most of her time alone in her study reading, intent upon learning the secrets of the prophet Madigan.
str_rumor_talk_nerati_1|he said that soldiers from the Empire often claim that a men called Neratius not only has a powerful voice, but also that his speeches stirred his men to win several battles against all odds.
str_rumor_talk_nerati_2|he was told that if the Empire had a few more men like Neratius, things would be very different there, because no man in the Empire is as brave or stoic as Neratius.
str_rumor_talk_nerati_3|he heard that citizens in the Empire wonder why Neratius remains unmarried. Some say it is because he can't find a woman who can meet his demanding ideals.
str_rumor_talk_nerati_4|he was told that ladies in the Empire are annoyed at Neratius, despite his being so handsome and such an famous soldier, because he refuses every proposal of marriage from their fathers.
str_rumor_talk_nerati_5|he heard from soldiers of the Empire that few generals know the tactics and strategies of the Old Empire as Neratius does. He is especially talented with fast maneuvers and engineering; they say he can build a bridge as fast as they used to in the old days!
str_rumor_talk_nerati_6|he heard that a man called Neratius just made a quite powerful speech during a meeting of the Empire lords, quite openly accusing some nobles of tolerance for and involvement with the Snake Cult. A good many high-nosed Empire Lords aren't too pleased with him just now! However elevated their rank, he did not spare even one from criticism.
str_rumor_talk_bryn_1|he heard there is a new Ravenstern champion. At the last tournament, a rival to Count Otto appeared. Though Count Otto was a popular lord, the new contestant was an unknown commoner. People were surprised when Otto fell in the final round and shocked when the contestant removed her helmet. Her name was Bryn, and she was a woman!
str_rumor_talk_bryn_2|he heard that after her surprise victory at the tournament, the warrior Bryn became a celebrity in Ravenstern. She was of common birth and her defeat of lords in single combat was surprising. Following her victory, she traveled from tavern to tavern, and people toasted her and sang bawdy songs. She was easily as big as a man, her laughter as boisterous, and soon she had a peasant militia in tow.
str_rumor_talk_bryn_3|he heard from a Ravenstern courtier that after the warrior Bryn's surprise tournament victory, she gained popularity with the commoners. That a mere peasant woman had personally defeated the lords of the realm only made her seem more dangerous. Several lords were plotting her assassination when King Gregory intervened, granting her the title of Lady Bryn.
str_rumor_talk_bryn_4|he heard from a Poinsbruk tavern keeper that after Bryn's victory in last year's tournament, she traveled throughout Ravenstern, drinking with the common folk. One day, she found herself pregnant. Instead of aborting her bastard child as many ladies would do, she bore it. All seemed well, until her babe mysteriously disappeared. Many of Bryn's supporters believe the lad was stolen by jealous nobles.
str_rumor_talk_bryn_5|he heard from the steward at Falcondark Castle that although most nobles in Ravenstern treat the upstart Lady Bryn with scorn, Count Otto has the utmost respect for the warrior-maid. He invites her to his estates often, and they spend long afternoons chatting by the hearth. Even when she was swollen with child, he treated her with a warrior's rough charm. Late into the night, the whole keep would shake with their boisterous laughter.
str_rumor_talk_bryn_6|he heard a bard sing the ballad of Lady Bryn, the She-Bear of Ravenstern. The whole crowd sang along. Word for word, they described her victory over Lord Otto at the tournament, and they cheered when King Gregory declared her a noble. When the song spoke of her bastard child, they cheered for him, too, crying, 'Long live Alwyn, Son of the She-Bear!'  Yet now her son is gone and all fear that he was stolen and killed by plotting nobles.'
str_rumor_talk_alec_1|he heard several stories about a lord named Alec, a skilled ranger and marksman. They say he lead several forays into the Mystmountain lands, and even rescued Ravenstern people captured by those savages.
str_rumor_talk_alec_2|he was told that there was a quite handsome fellow in Ravenstern named Alec, and that Alec happens also to be one of the greatest rangers in Ravenstern. They say, however, that he does  not like to hang about courts or cities, but enjoys the wilderness much more.
str_rumor_talk_alec_3|he heard that Alec, that Ravenstern ranger son of a lord who is the talk of all the ladies, is incredibly skilled with a bow, as well as knowledgeable about survival in the wilderness, but feels very out of place in a court or city. In fact, he says the perils of the wilderness pale beside the dangers of court intrigue!
str_rumor_talk_alec_4|he was told that Alec's family is desperate to get him well-married. They have introduced several good potential fiancees, but he refused every one, claiming he hopes to find a woman who is as comfortable in the wilderness and skilled with a bow as he is. Not bloody likely he'll find a woman like that!
str_rumor_talk_alec_5|he said that despite his severe expression, simple clothes, and his laconic demeanor, Alec is actually a very kind man.
str_rumor_talk_alec_6|he said that there are few marksmen so good as Alec, even amongst Raverstern's most skilled rangers.
str_rumor_talk_snake_1|he saw two armed men intimidating a shopkeeper. They kept asking the merchant if he had seen an escaped slave, a woman the High Priestess was keen to get her hands on.
str_rumor_talk_snake_2|he saw a hooded and cloaked warrior who, while hiding in the shadows, was speaking to two street urchins. Money changed hands and the urchins promptly ran away. The warrior laughed softly then disappeared into the night.
str_rumor_talk_snake_3|he saw a hooded woman dressed in dark clothing. She approached a tall warrior who bowed to her. She pulled out a wickedly curved dagger, plunged it into his throat and he fell stone dead into the gutter. She kicked him once, wiped the blade on his carcass, then walked down the street as if nothing had happened.
str_rumor_talk_snake_4|he overheard two travelers talking about the rise of the Snake Cult and how they demand either gold or blood to join one of their covens.
str_rumor_talk_snake_5|he saw a drunk man leaving the tavern. Across the street was a, um, lady of questionable virtue. The poor sot walked up and grabbed her. Gave her a big kiss, he did. Then the man just sort of stiffened and fell over. The lady looked up, saw him, and smiled. He swears on the grave of his old dad she had fangs.
str_rumor_talk_snake_6|he said one came right into the tavern! Snake worshiper, aye. Huge man, armored in poison green. Big as day. Didn't even try to hide those serpent emblems, neither. Nah, he stepped right in like he owned the place. 'Twas everything he could do to hold his water!
str_rumor_talk_snake_7|he said the Snakes took out a caravan north of Ethos. A whole caravan! They're getting bolder, I tell you. One of the survivors came through here yesterday. He said he saw one of their knights take out ten men! Glad I am safe here, in truth.
str_rumor_talk_snake_8|he said he'd learned something about the Snake ladies, that he did. Did you know they can kill you with one kiss? Kissing, I tell you! Like we need anything else desecrated by those cretins.
str_rumor_talk_snake_9|he heard two soldiers talking. They were telling stories, right? One told the other they had tangled with the Cultists again. The other asked, 'How many lost this time?' '15 Legionnaires,' was the answer. I thought they were joking, right? But no one was laughing.
str_rumor_talk_snake_10|he said his mother refuses to leave the house. She says she saw people in her fields, two nights back. She could not see what they were doing, but they lit a big fire. Then they started shouting something like AZEE! And the fire, it grew tall and started swaying like a snake. She has stayed locked in her room since!
str_rumor_talk_snake_11|he saw a strange woman who never moved her mouth when she spoke. She was asking after someone named {playername}, or some such. Said {reg63?he:she} was 'Chosen of Azi Dahaka.' Ye gods, I would hate to be that person.
str_rumor_talk_snake_12|he said the Snake Cult has been sniffing around here again. Apparently, some adventurer named {playername} has been making their lives difficult. Bully for {reg63?him:her}, but you never heard that from me, right?
str_rumor_talk_snake_13|he said he spied a group of odd folks in the woods. They were swaying and dancing around a fire. Who cares, right? But he said the fire was alive! He said the fire and smoke coiled around them just like a snake!
str_rumor_talk_snake_14|he heard the cooper say he had lost his daughter. Then he said something about snakes in the night. I think he meant them Anaconda Knights. They say that the Knights will steal girls away. Not to ravish, no sir. For the priestesses.
str_rumor_talk_snake_15|he heard something interesting from a caravan master. Seems young girls have been disappearing all along the southern seacoast. Folks are blaming it on those Snake worshipers. They say the priestesses have to begin training young.
str_rumor_talk_snake_16|he told me he found an abandoned Snake Cult outpost on his last journey. They had stripped almost everything out, but left a bag under some rubble. Know what was in it? Snake venom and a baby bottle.
str_rumor_talk_snake_17|he told me that a huge snake was spotted in the hills outside Janos last month. He said so many snake worshipers showed up you could walk from Fenada to Chelez on their heads!
str_rumor_talk_snake_18|he said that if I was to ever meet an adventurer called {playername}, I should warn {reg63?him:her} to steer clear of Empire lands. The Snake Cult has been searching high and low for {reg63?him:her}.
str_rumor_talk_snake_19|he noticed the charm I keep to ward away evil. 'Keep that close', he said. 'I have seen snake worshipers outside the tavern three times this week. They think they are disguised, but I can spot them a mile away, and they are looking for someone'.
str_rumor_talk_snake_20|he told me he had actually camped with a snake worshiper. Said the guy kept him up most of the night with stories about the greatness of Azi Dahaka. He claimed she manifests as a giant hooded cobra on stormy nights.
str_rumor_talk_snake_21|he told me that he had heard an odd noise from an alleyway the other night, and went to investigate. When he got there, all he found was on old cloak, three green scales, and a scrawled note saying {playername}.
str_rumor_talk_snake_22|he said he had not heard from his cousin on the coast in nearly a year. So, he went to investigate, and when he got there, the house was gone; burnt to the ground. On a stone near the ruin was scrawled 'VIVAT AZI DAHAKA'.
str_rumor_talk_snake_23|he spoke to me of an old legend. It seems that on stormy nights in the old country, worshipers of Azi Dahaka would creep through villages in search of little girls to steal away. They would take them off to their lair and spend years turning them into Snake Priestesses.
str_rumor_talk_snake_24|he saw a man approach a cloaked woman in a secluded doorway. Something changed hands, and the woman pulled back her hood and blew lightly on him. He stiffened, tried to turn away, and fell dead at her feet! She gave a tight-lipped smile, raised her hood, and disappeared into the alley.
str_rumor_talk_snake_25|he said he went to a tavern out in Laria, and heard that the Snake Cult has been seen as far inland as Rebache! If they get a foothold in Sarleon, they will be out of the reach of old Marius. Bet that will stick in his royal craw!
str_rumor_talk_snake_26|he saw a woman and her wee daughter walking in the marketplace. He had barely looked away when he heard a scream. The mother was standing stiff as a board, blood running from two fang marks on her throat. The babe was nowhere to be seen.
str_rumor_talk_snake_27|he told me he had overheard the Seneschal talking to the Sheriff. Turns out, two Empire vassal lords were discovered to have hidden Snake shrines in their manors. After all the work the Imperator has done, to find something like this now must be crushing!
str_rumor_talk_snake_28|he turned to me and said, 'Why is there a snake charm over your door?' and I said I said aaah We are looking for you, {playername}, AND WE WILL FIND YOU!  Aah I am sorry. What were we talking about?
str_rumor_talk_snake_29|he said Marius is running scared. The Snake Cult has been on the rise, and nothing the Imperator does seems to stop them. It is almost like they know his plans before he does. These days, Marius is accusing everything but the doorposts of spying.
str_rumor_talk_snake_30|he heard from a hunter that more and more shrines to Azi Dahaka have been discovered all along the southern coast. The Snake Cult has been far more active lately, almost as if they are preparing for something.
str_rumor_talk_snake_31|he heard from a ship captain that Snake Cult relics from the old Empire are being smuggled into Cez in record numbers. Weapons and armor from the old country are pouring in as well. Mark my words, the snakes are up to something big.
str_rumor_talk_snake_32|he said he was walking on the Ethos road a few weeks back and found the remains of a caravan. Its erstwhile guards had been left dead, strewn across the roadway. The cargo was smashed, but had not been looted. In the road was written in blood, 'AZI DAHAKA ADVENIO'.
str_rumor_talk_snake_33|he said that the last caravan he guarded was attacked by snake worshipers. Huge men in green armor poured from the forest along the roadside. But, when all seemed lost, the knights pulled up short. The priestess shouted, '{playername}', and those Snakes just melted away.
str_rumor_talk_snake_34|he told me of a legend from the old Baccus Empire. Once, long ago, agents of Azi Dahaka began raiding in greater numbers than ever before. No one was safe. Then, a mighty warlord rose among them and united the marauding worshipers into a vast army. History is a wheel, my friend. Be careful.
str_rumor_talk_sing_1|he was told the Singalians ancestors are part D'Shar, which makes them distant cousins of the Jatu. They all came from the Old Empire to Pendor as mercenaries.
str_rumor_talk_sing_2|he heard that Singalians have a rigid code of honor which forbids retreat from battle, and also involves great loss of personal honor should their leader flee from battle.
str_rumor_talk_sing_3|he heard a story about how the Singalians got their name: their ancestors came as mercenaries from far away, but refused to settle in the town of Singal. For some strange reason they kept the name to remind them of what they had rejected.
str_rumor_talk_sing_4|he said that the Singalians attack by stealth from the deep desert, appearing as if by magic.
str_rumor_talk_sing_5|he was told that, despite having a code of honor which demands death before retreat, Singalians are not suicidal; I mean, they won't give their lives away for someone they perceive as unfit to die for.
str_rumor_talk_sing_6|he was told by a D'Shar merchant that few people try to travel into the depths of the desert where the Singalians dwell. They say the travel is just to risky, and too many get lost on the way.
str_rumor_talk_sing_7|he heard that even if you manage to find a Singalian camp in the desert, there is still the problem of their suspiciousness of strangers, even their D'Shar cousins.
str_rumor_talk_sing_8|he heard from a man who travelled to trade with the Singalians that the desert where they roam is so harsh that often an entire clan is lost to a sandstorm. Any lucky survivors are sometimes accepted into another clan, so long as there is no blood feud between the clans.
str_rumor_talk_sing_9|he was told that, despite the harsh conditions of the desert, the Singalians appear to truly enjoy riding there with their clanbrothers. They know how to survive there and where water can be found. If you really need to go to the desert, see if you can find one of them to guide you.
str_rumor_talk_sing_10|he said he saw a merchant making plans to travel into the desert to trade with the Singalians. The fellow must either know what he is doing or be crazy -  no one knows for sure where exactly in the desert you can find the Singalians.
str_rumor_talk_sing_11|he said the Singalians navigate the desert by finding markers of dead men's bones left by the vultures and the tracks of desert sand snakes. No one really knows how they find their way there.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_1|he said that a friend of his told him those worthless tribal D'Shar are all stirred up by some religious fanatic out of the deep desert.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_2|he said that, according to Torbah rumor, the Bahadur Khan himself beheaded a man for making a joke about an invasion from the deep desert. I guess the joke was on him!
str_rumor_talk_dshar_3|he said that, as per a Singal armor merchant, the D'Shar have temporarily ceased their regular blood feuds on direct orders of the Bahadur Khan, so as to preserve men for Pendor's battles.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_4|he heard in Sarleon that the D'Shar are raiding for women these days, because they apparently do not have enough of their own to go around. Can you believe they marry multiple wives? Talk about tents full of trouble!
str_rumor_talk_dshar_5|he said his D'Shar trading partner told him that over two hundred have died in the latest Yusafzai blood feud, despite a command from the Bahadur Khan that they desist immediately.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_6|he said that a wine merchant told him about a D'Shar wedding in Singal that came to a sad end. The wedding was meant to end a blood feud, but it broke out anew at the feast and both the bride and groom were killed.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_7|he said that at D'Shar weddings, they fire arrows into the air and invariably some of the guests are killed. Jokes about the perils of weddings are standard amongst the D'Shar.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_8|he heard a rumor about some renegade fanatic from the deep desert who has called blood feud against the Bahadur Khan himself!
str_rumor_talk_dshar_9|he heard from the Captain of the Guard in Ishkoman that the Bahadur Khan has ordered increased troops and vigilance in all D'Shar towns, due to some unspecified threat.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_10|he heard a rumor that the Bahadur Khan sits even more uneasily on his throne these days, because a renegade sheik has promised to take it from him.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_11|he heard that the talk in the Torbah taverns is all about some fanatic who foams at the mouth and falls down in fits of holy madness. He has converted many D'Shar to his strange religion and inspires absolute loyalty.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_12|he was talking to an Ishkoman horse trader, who says he lost half his men and his entire string to another pack of raiders. The Pathani are reputedly the worst horse thieves in the plains.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_13|he was told that an entire D'Shar camp now stands empty, and no one knows what became of the people there. They simply disappeared.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_14|he heard a funny story! The Bahadur Khan just took another wife, and his first wife is furious! She wanted him to marry her younger sister instead. Talk about a glutton for punishment!
str_rumor_talk_dshar_15|he heard that the D'Shar prize black horses so highly because their god, Indar, manifests as a beautiful black stallion, swift as the wind.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_16|he overheard a Legionnaire say that the Turkmani raiders are giving the Empire a terrible time, just now. The Legionnaires are fit to be tied, because they cannot catch them.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_17|he overheard in the Singal tavern that a D'Shar renegade, Sheik Salivate, or something like that, is raising hell in the D'Shar Territories these days.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_18|he heard a rumor that Sheik Shalavan feeds some kind of drug to his followers that makes them fight fiercely. It is said that he denies them the drug before battle and tells them they will get no more unless they win.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_19|he said that there is talk in the marketplace that someone needs to do something about the incessant D'Shar raids. There are several tribes now that do nothing but steal goods from others and capture their women. They produce nothing but bloodshed.
str_rumor_talk_dshar_20|he heard that in the Singal market, the traders complain that they need the escort of an army just to get to Torbah, the cursed Raiders have gotten so outrageous.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_1|he said that he met a Caravan Master who had been raided by the Jatu. The merchant was astounded that boys as young as twelve are part of their army. Imagine making children into soldiers!
str_rumor_talki_jatu_2|he says that a Jatu tribal warrior told him that someone named Zulkar is uniting all the Jatu under one banner, with the intention of taking Sarleon.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_3|he said that an innkeeper in Laria told him that Jatu incursions are increasing. They have wiped out militia patrols from Laria several times.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_4|he heard from a man who trades with the Jatu, that all the women taken in their raids end up in concubinage, bearing child after child for the Jatu horselords.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_5|he said that talk in the Poinsbruk tavern is that if something is not done about Warlord Zulkar, he will be pitching his tent in the Poinsbruk town square in no time.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_6|he heard a Jatu Lancer claim that their god, Vata, joins in their battles, and shoots in the back any he thinks are trying to desert. Only the Jatu would choose that git for a god.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_7|he heard from a Jatu slave en route to the salt mines that the Jatu test their young boys for strength and courage and kill those they deem weak or cowardly.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_8|he heard several times in Laria that the only good thing about K'Juda the Ravager is his predilection for killing Noldor.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_9|he met a man named Ambrose who trades with the Jatu. His impression is that not all the Jatu want to follow K'Juda, but he is forcing them to ally with him.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_10|he met a trader, ashen-pale and trembling, who was drinking heavily in the Poinsbruk tavern. He says he found the bodies of some militia who had been tortured to death by K'Juda, that Jatu Warlord.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_11|he said that Liam, a friend of his who collects Noldor artifacts, says that although the Noldor hate Warlord Zulkar, they seem to grudgingly respect his battle prowess and honorable behavior.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_12|he heard from a captured Jatu that K'Juda mounts Noldor heads on poles outside his tent and has a veritable forest of them on display.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_13|he said the he spoke with a peddler, whom he was quite sure was a disguised Jatu. He casually mentioned a new warlord, Zulkar, who is very strong and gaining great influence amongst the Jatu.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_14|he heard from a Laria trader that the Jatu are raiding more heavily for women, by order of K'Juda. He wants to breed more soldiers for his army.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_15|he overheard a Ravenstern seneschal, who was drunk in the tavern, claim the King soils his armor at the mere thought of taking on K'Juda the Ravager and his army. And this despite their increased raids near Poinsbruk.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_16|he says the D'Shar historians claim the Jatu are cousins of the D'Shar tribes. Centuries ago, the D'Shar tribes migrated to Pendor from the great Kashanar Plains, far across the sea, a place now claimed by the Jatuzin.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_17|he said the word in Sarleon is that King Ulric is worried about an invasion from Warlord Zulkar and his Jatu, since his armies are already overtaxed dealing with his other aggressive neighbors.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_18|he said that the Sarleon knights hold Warlord Zulkar in high esteem for his many acts of honor and bravery. Very few would care to cross lances with him, however.
str_rumor_talki_jatu_19|he said that the latest word from Laria is that K'Juda the Ravager leaves scrolls, pinned by javelins to Noldor corpses, stating that all Noldor will die similarly at his hands. I almost pity the Noldor!
str_rumor_talki_jatu_20|he said the abbot of Poinsbruk preaches that all who take up the fight against the invading Jatu are under the protection of UllrVetr.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_1|he heard from a Barclay trader, whom he met in Javiksholm, that they burn Heretics at the stake there. Some of them are reputed to be Knights of the Dawn gone bad!
str_rumor_talki_heretics_2|he said that a Fierdsvain abbot told him that the Heretic goddess, Erida Occisor, grows in power with every human sacrifice given her by her priests.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_3|he saw a man who was unmistakably a Heretic priest. He briefly spoke to a couple of urchins, handed them some coins and the urchins promptly scarpered off.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_4|he was told by a prisoner, a Vanskerry Raider, that the Heretics are terrifying the whole Fierdsvain. They are taking peasants from all the villages and sacrificing them to their Dark Goddess.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_5|he said that a Nal Tar horse merchant told him that he found a dying Turkmani on the way here. He was missing an arm, and lay dying. He said something called Eyegrim the Devourer had ripped off his arm and eaten it before his very eyes!
str_rumor_talki_heretics_6|he said he had talked on the road with a wandering traveller, who told him that the Knights of the Dawn have dispatched a Paladin to Pendor to help fight the Heretics. He is reputed to be a formidable fighter.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_7|he heard from a farmer in the Fierdsvain that they have to guard their graveyards now, so the Heretics do not raise their buried relatives to swell their numbers.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_8|he came across two women, one of whom was in shock and seemed oblivious to her surroundings. The other one told him that a Knight of the Dawn had rescued them from a horrible fate at the hands of Death Worshipers.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_9|he heard two sellswords complaining that the Heretics have demons amongst them, which are almost impossible to kill. They are filthy undead things, with decaying faces. One said to the other that he could smell them well before he saw them. How revolting!
str_rumor_talki_heretics_10|he heard from a merchant that the corpses he saw on the road to Janos had been gnawed and the marrow sucked right out of the bones. The Koningur is trying to quash the rumor, but it is all over the markets now.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_11|he overheard a merchant in the Windholm market say that a Heretic Confessor had been seen outside the city gates. The confessor was offering a reward for knowledge of the whereabouts of one {playername}.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_12|he overheard talk between an ugly old woman, probably the madam of a brothel, and a hooded man, who was most likely a Heretic Priest. He told the old bird she had best come up with more girls for the Solstice sacrifices, or she would assuredly regret it.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_13|he heard from one of the caravan guards, in the alley behind the market, that the Heretics have just killed another Caravan Master, and taken his guards and apprentices for sacrifice. One lucky apprentice managed to get away and reported the ambush.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_14|he heard from a Barclay historian, currently lecturing in the Abbey at Valonbray, that the Heretics were originally saintly priests, until they were lured into worship of the Dark Goddess. They are spreading all over Pendor now, and a certain danger to all travelers.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_15|he heard from a farmer in the Valonbray market that the Heretic goddess has our poor Thallo Ver Shures on the run. Pity, she is a kind little goddess, for all she runs starkers through the fields waving flowers.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_16|he swears the Heretics have portable altars, so they can instantly sacrifice their captives on the spot! What is Pendor coming to, that murdering perverts like the Heretics roam free, killing at will?!
str_rumor_talki_heretics_17|he heard about a group of Fierdsvain Maiden Cavalry partying in the Javiksholm tavern. The innkeeper told him he overheard them say that the Heretics are ferocious fighters, though they fill their ranks with outcasts and other rabble. The lassies seemed a mite fearful, which surprised him.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_18|he said that one of the wharf traders, an old friend of his, is bemoaning the fact that his business is down, because the Barclay traders do not come so often to Pendor these days. He says they are afraid of those roving bands of Heretics.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_19|he said that the innkeeper in Valonbray overheard a thinly-disguised Heretic priest say that he was most annoyed at the number of potential sacrifices killed fighting, rather than merely stunned by his men. He threatened to sacrifice his own men if they do not do better.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_20|he said that he ran into a Squire in service to a Knight of the Dawn. The Squire confessed that he wept at their discovery of the bodies of dozens of young girls, lying next to a Heretic altar. Their hearts had been torn from their breasts. He and the Knight hunted down and slew every last one of the evil perpetrators, but he still has nightmares about the girls.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_21|he saw a Heretic Confessor threatening a hooded man in the alley behind the castle. He said the man was so affrighted that he pissed himself, all the while bowing, scraping and pleading for another chance. 
str_rumor_talki_heretics_22|he heard that the Windholm armorer is turning a pretty penny making armor for the Heretics on the sly. It is also rumored he gave that nagging wife of his to them for sacrifice, as she has not been seen for some weeks.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_23|he overheard a terrified woman, pleading frantically with the city guards for help in finding her teenage daughter. Her daughter was friends with three boys who were rumored to belong to some sort of coven. All of them had disappeared without a trace.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_24|he said that he overheard an armsman talking about a battle his troop fought with the Heretics. He said that some of them were as skilled as any Knight he had seen in a tournament.
str_rumor_talki_heretics_25|he saw two men, in skull-emblazoned livery, sneak over the castle walls, dragging a bound man with a sack over his head. Before he could raise an alarm, the two Heretics had fled.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_1|he heard one of the Fierdsvain Lords say that the Vanskerries want the Lords to join them in overpowering Pendor. My opinion is that the Lords have grown too soft for that.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_2|he said a trader friend of ours, Gunnar of Valonbray, says his cousin, a Vanskerry Raider currently locked in the local dungeon, claims a powerful Vanskerry Jarl plans to bring a large army into Pendor.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_3|he said he was looking to buy some slaves from Ramun and heard from one Vanskerry galley slave that the Vanskerry Raiders think Pendor is ripe for the picking.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_4|he heard a merchant from Windholm say that after he finished his business in the market, he took a short cut through an alley, and observed a tall, blonde man, obviously a Vanskerry Jarl, threatening the Valonbray horse merchant with death, if he did not produce better details about Valonbray's defenses.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_5|he said that local rumor has it that a cousin to Inar Hairybreeks, son of his own old auntie, is amongst the latest Vanskerry Raiders captured. He is trying to persuade the Koningur to release him. He will not have much luck there!
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_6|he heard in the Windholm market that the Vanskerry raids are on the increase because the Pendor pickings are so profitable for the Raiders. They raided Jayek again yesterday.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_7|he said his informant overheard some Barclay merchants talking in Windholm. They say their profits are down considerably because the caravans coming to Windholm from Ravenstern get raided too often and they cannot get enough goods.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_8|he heard some farmers complaining over their ale in the Valonbray tavern. They say it simply is not worth farming these days, what with raids taking all their harvested crops before they can get them to market.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_9|he heard the lord say that, if rumor does not lie, all the Fierdsvain towns have been infiltrated by Vanskerry agents posing as Fierdsvain merchants! Unbelievable!
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_10|he said the foreign Jarls claim that all the Fierdsvain belongs in truth to Vanskerry, and should be under their rule, since it was conquered and settled by Vanskerry Raiders.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_11|he overheard some captured Vanskerry Raiders, en route to the slave pens, laughing about how they would have their revenge on the Fierdsvain shortly, though they did not go into detail about what is planned.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_12|he heard a man, who claimed to be an escaped Vanskerry captive, say there is a plan afoot to free all the Raider prisoners. That's all he overheard, and I don't know how much credence to give the story.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_13|he heard Thomas of Rane, a trader from Ravenstern, tell of a narrow escape. His caravan hired scouts, and their outriders ran into a good-sized pack of Vanskerries. The Raiders killed all the scouts while the caravan ran for it.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_14|he told me an acquaintance of his said he could scarce credit what he overheard some sailors say in the Valonbray tavern. These more frequent raids are supposedly intended to soften up the Fierdsvain in advance of full-scale Vankserry invasion!
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_15|he said Thomas of Rane, a merchant friend of his, says the Ravenstern merchants are speaking of hiring a mercenary troop to protect their caravans to the Fierdsvain towns.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_16|he said he heard from one of his friends, cousin to a Vanskerry, that their god, Haf Sigla, sends them winds blowing in the direction of Pendor to aid their longboats in sailing here. We need a god to send winds that blow in the opposite direction!
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_17|he heard an interesting explanation of the reason behind the Vanskerry raids. Apparently, if they do not raid, they have no means of support. They are unable to farm their own cold land, so they live off the food they steal.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_18|he said his grandfather came here as a Vanskerry Raider and married a Fierdsvain farm lass. Vanskerries love our rich farmland here because they have none of their own back home.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_19|he said he did not know if he should pass this on or not, but anyway talk amongst some of the Fierdsvain geezers is that the Vanskerries think that life in Pendor has destroyed their cousins' strength and turned them soft and luxury-loving.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_20|he told me a shocking story! A Caravan Master said that his group passed a pack of Vanskerry Raiders abusing some peasant women they'd kidnapped in a raid.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_21|he heard an amusing story about the Vanskerry Raiders from the bookseller. He said they raided a Sarleon caravan carrying ale and drank it up on the spot. One of their captives got loose, tied them up and castrated every drunken one of them!
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_22|he said one of the Vanskerry Jarls claimed to own a powerful, magic axe that could cut through the strongest armor.
str_rumor_talki_vanskerry_23|he said that all the women taken by the Vanskerry Raiders, and many of the men, end up as thralls in the North. What a terrible fate!
str_rumor_talki_red_1|he saw two men talking in an alleyway. He could not hear what they said, but one passed a packet, and they parted with a complicated series of hand gestures. As they left, one of them dropped a red leather glove. Watching them walk away, he was careful not to pick it up.
str_rumor_talki_red_2|he spoke to a slaver last week. It appears that well-trained soldiers have become the slave of choice on the market, because that seems to be all they are interested in purchasing. That is odd, as high-end soldiers usually make poor galley slaves. One loose chain and they kill their owners!
str_rumor_talki_red_3|he heard two badly disguised Brotherhood bullyboys talking in the tavern last night. Someone is disrupting their harvester gangs. He did not hear the whole discussion, but the name {playername} was bandied about quite a bit.
str_rumor_talki_red_4|he told me that oh, damn. It is you! Listen, {playername}, you need to no, never mind how I know you. Just get out of town. The Brotherhood are crawling all over this place, and they are aiming for one target:  You. Someone is paying top dollar. Now go. You never saw me.
str_rumor_talki_red_5|he found out that the Brotherhood are angling to get into the weapons trade. They already have the slave market tied up, mostly because it is distasteful. But weapons? That is a new direction for the boys in red, and if they know something we are unaware of well, I would sleep light, were I you.
str_rumor_talki_red_6|he heard from the guild master that the blacksmith got visited by the rouge stooges last night seems he decided not to pay for his new 'apprentice'. Claimed the boy simply dropped in on him and wanted a job. Poor, dumb bastard. They broke his hammer-hand.
str_rumor_talki_red_7|he saw it plain as day. Three bloodyboys beating up a shopkeeper on the steps of his own house! And the town guards did they do aught to help? No, they walked right on past, as blind as men can be paid to be. Nobody even trusts the sheriff in this town any more.
str_rumor_talki_red_8|he said to me I should never be late in paying the guards, and here I am thinking I must have hired security in my sleep, right? But no, he was talking about the Reds! I left Ethos to get away from those dogs and here they set up shop in my own bloody courtyard. A man never wins with those gits.
str_rumor_talki_red_9|he noticed a certain, well, preference, shall we say. With the slavers. They have all gone from nice docile galley-strokers to myrmidons. Suddenly soldiers are pulling top dollar. Listen, friend. Those Reds? They know all the folks who know. They are moving mercenaries, plain and simple. What does that tell ya?
str_rumor_talki_red_10|he knows some folks on the inside at the Brotherhood. Worst infighting he has ever seen. They like to act all organized, but when was the last time you saw more that a couple of them together? That is purely because they cannot stand each other! Bloody taffers hate themselves as much as we do!
str_rumor_talki_red_11|he overheard a Buyer in the tavern talking to a bounty hunter. Apparently someone is rather keen to buy a slave named {playername}. The price mentioned was pretty steep. On the other hand, I hear {reg63?he:she} captains an adventuring company. Fat chance of the Reds tackling that, eh?
str_rumor_talki_red_12|he said he told the butcher that the Brotherhood act all big here in the safety of the city, but out there? They are so much fodder, scrabbling for a few farmer captives. They just cannot cooperate enough to pose a threat. Next day, his house burns down. What did we learn? The butcher is a snitch.
str_rumor_talki_red_13|he saw a bounty hunter with a line of slaves. Sorry looking sods they were, too. All stumbling and weak, unfed for days most likely. Perfect galley-fodder, they was. And the ruddy bugger turns them away. Said he had no room in the pens for low rent strokers. What, did the galleys all sink?
str_rumor_talki_red_14|he heard from the guildsman that two of the Brotherhood houses are feuding. Three men have been found killed in. creative fashion. And two more are missing. This is better than the arena! I would place bets, but the bookies are all Reds!
str_rumor_talki_red_15|he said the boys in red had been over to the granary. Seems they decided the price there was too low, and needed doubling. Like they would know! They are just spooked because that caravan got whacked by the bloody snake handlers down south.
str_rumor_talki_red_16|he has not had a good run in weeks. The Brotherhood keep driving the price up, and no one wants to pay. At this rate he will be running around to each little farm, buying it at the source. Sure, it's time consuming, but when was the last time the farmers cared a whistle for the Reds? 
str_rumor_talki_red_17|he heard the Reds had been pushing for the cobbler to sign on with them. I mean, yeah, the cobbler is a second cousin twice removed from the Seneschal, but is that enough to get offered a membership now? Oh well, that is his funeral.
str_rumor_talki_red_18|he saw the captain of an adventuring company troop into the tavern with a whole gang of ruddy-buddies in tow as prisoners! A harvester gang had tangled with the wrong company. Did his heart no end of good to watch the Brotherhood buy back its own.
str_rumor_talki_red_19|he sat with me and he said wanted out. I asked him, out of what? He just said out. Poor sap. He looked so sad. He looked even sadder when the other Reds came to take him in hand, but what was I to do? If I had said anything it would have been my hide. Better him than me, that's what I say.
str_rumor_talki_red_20|he walked in and simply said, 'They know.'  'Know what?' says I. 'Don't play coy,' he says, 'they know {playername} has been here. Next time, signal them or there will be trouble.'  As if I know what {playername} looks like! The Reds can go rot, is what I say. {playername} indeed. Pffft.
str_rumor_talki_red_21|he saw a priestess leap between a knight of Dawn and a member of the Red Brotherhood, shouting, 'Everything casts a shadow, even Pendor. We cannot cut it away. It is an inseparable, holy part of us. If the Red Brotherhood didn't satisfy our vices, then a thousand other gangs would rise to take their place. There would be war on the streets, war for our lust, our sloth, our wrath!' Yet before she could say more, the knight slew her.
str_rumor_talki_red_22|he heard from a barkeep that the Red Brotherhood ran a brothel in Sarleon with Noldor women. It enticed him, so next time he visited Sarleon he wanted to pay them a visit, even if it cost him 1,000 denar. At first, he even thought it might be worth it, as the women there were exceedingly beautiful. Yet as he lay with one, he discovered that her pointed ears were sculpted with wax, and outraged, he stormed out of the brothel, the mistress laughing behind him.
str_rumor_talki_red_23|he heard from a militiaman in Ravenstern that the Red Brotherhood had been organizing dog fights. Although King Gregory was trying to put a stop to it, the Brotherhood was always a step ahead of them. And late into the night, they'd hear the howls and snarls of dogs needlessly killing one another.
str_rumor_talki_red_24|he heard from a wandering refugee that she had only just managed to escape a Red Brotherhood slave camp. They forced her and countless others to cultivate a new strain of sage that, when smoked, gave prophetic visions... and sometimes led to madness. Apparently, it's all the rage amongst a certain circle of nobles.
str_rumor_talki_red_25|he heard from the barkeep in Janos that the Red Brotherhood and the Snake Cult were feuding endlessly over vice in the Empire. For generations, it had been under the control of the Red Brotherhood, and many local thugs and dealers are still loyal to their former masters. But the Snake Cult has control of the higher classes now, and slowly they're working their way down, weeding out the last bastions of Brotherhood influence.
str_rumor_talki_red_26|he heard from a shadowy merchant in Torbah that one can buy anything from the Red Brotherhood, even objects they don't strictly own. When he asked for the Khan's chalice, the merchant simply laughed and said it would cost 40,000 denars. For the right price, anything could be bought and sold amongst the Brotherhood.
str_rumor_talki_adven_1|he said that the local Lord has hired an Adventuring Company to search for treasure on his behalf. He supposedly has a treasure map. I wonder how much treasure he will actually see out of that deal?
str_rumor_talki_adven_2|he said some of the Adventuring Companies really have it in for someone named {playername} and are looking for {reg63?him:her} all over. The name is the same, I hope that is not you!
str_rumor_talki_adven_3|he heard a Lord hired an Adventuring Company to escort his wife to Sarleon, and the bastards kidnapped her and demanded a hefty ransom from him. He is positively apoplectic over the affair.
str_rumor_talki_adven_4|he said that rumor has it a Sarleon merchant tried to double-cross one of the Adventuring Companies and came to grief over it. They raided five of his caravans to get what they said was their payment due. He failed to overhear what the merchant had hired them to do.
str_rumor_talki_adven_5|he heard that a farmer, Yanus of Pern, is beside himself. He had a fight with his wife, and she up and ran off. Damned if she did not join an Adventure Company. Mind you, she blacked his eyes and bashed his head with an iron skillet before she left, so she is a fighter, all right.
str_rumor_talki_adven_6|he overheard one of the Adventuring Companies laughing it up in the Senderfall tavern. They were drinking toasts to some Lord, who had just paid them a hefty ransom for the safe return of his wife. 
str_rumor_talki_adven_7|he said the Jatu massacred an Adventuring Company they caught poking around ruins in the Jatu hills. I guess they were looking for treasure. Too bad they found the Jatu!
str_rumor_talki_adven_8|he heard it was downright dangerous to search the Noldor ruins these days, because the Adventuring Companies are looking for artifacts and treasures there and do not welcome competition.
str_rumor_talki_adven_9|he told me the Ethos innkeeper says she is really pleased that one of the Adventuring Companies is using her inn for a base while they search for something near there. Her wine sales have tripled and she has had to order more ale, as well.
str_rumor_talki_adven_10|he was told a Cez Caravan Master claims that the Empire is currently crawling with Adventuring Companies. I wonder what they are all doing there?
str_rumor_talki_adven_11|he said a Legionnaire told him that the Adventuring Companies are fighting with the Renegade Knights in the Empire. He said he hopes all of them exterminate one another and save the Legion some trouble.
str_rumor_talki_adven_12|he heard from a squire who escaped the massacre, that he was the only survivor of an Adventuring Company which fell afoul of the Noldor in the Woods of Laria. They were looking for Noldor artifacts there.
str_rumor_talki_adven_13|he heard from a man who claims he saw an Adventuring Company ambushed while they were looking for treasure in Rane. He did not mention who attacked them.
str_rumor_talki_adven_14|he said the Adventuring Companies, especially that one run by Meregan Kierlic, the Griffonsword Company, actively recruit woman fighters.
str_rumor_talki_adven_15|he said most of the Adventure Companies will honor their given words, so long as they get paid on time for their jobs. 
str_rumor_talki_adven_16|he heard from a guard captain in Avendor that he made the mistake of propositioning a woman in one of the Adventure Companies. She knocked him into the wall, kicked him where it hurt the most and put her dagger to his throat, all the while damning him for his effrontery in quite poetic terms.
str_rumor_talki_adven_17|he said members of one of the Adventuring Companies were in the tavern, drinking away their disappointment. They failed to find the treasure marked on the map they bought. He said the Traveler who sold it to them is in real trouble.
str_rumor_talki_adven_18|he heard that the Valonbray innkeeper has banned all Adventuring Companies from his tavern because one of them tore up the place last week.
str_rumor_talki_adven_19|he said any one of the Adventuring Company captains would sell off his own old mother if thought he could get a few denars for her.
str_rumor_talki_adven_20|he heard that there were recruiters in Barclay looking for young nobles to join some of the Pendor Adventure Companies. They promise their recruits riches beyond their wildest ken.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_1|he said you should not blame some of the boys who turned to banditry. The Lords hang their fathers for poaching and send their sheriffs to confiscate their farms before the hanged man is done kicking. What else can the lads do, at that point?
str_rumor_talki_bandit_2|he said one of the Red Brotherhood told him that he knew several lads who turned bandit because of what a Lord did to their sisters. They call it 'Jus Primae Noctis' or some such thing.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_3|he said a caravan master told him that between the outlaws and those Rougie Stoogie bastards, it was worth his life to get a caravan from Sarleon to Avendor unmolested without an Adventuring Company escorting it.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_4|he heard a bandit boast that the outlaws have started joining up with the Heretics, because those murdering bastards let them have a go at the girls before they sacrifice them.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_5|he heard the merchants in Sarleon have petitioned the King to quit hanging the outlaws. They want him to have them drawn and quartered in the public square as examples.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_6|he said the Outcasts are cast out for good reason. A lot of them get thrown out of their own villages for bad behavior and petty crimes.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_7|he said the Red Brotherhood only recruits bandits when they are scraping the bottom of the barrel for more men. He should have said the 'top of the barrel', since they are all scum and scum floats to the surface, haha.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_8|he said some of the outlaw groups are joining the Mystmountain Raider clans. Some clan chief has promised them land when the Raiders take over Ravenstern. Gullible fools, those bandits!
str_rumor_talki_bandit_9|he heard from an Outlaw Chief that someone called {playername} had called the bandit 'verminous scum'. Heh, he had to ask what 'verminous' meant before he took offense. He did not seem to object to the 'scum' part.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_10|he heard in the Javiksholm tavern that some of the bandit groups are talking about ganging up on {playername} because {reg63?he:she} has killed so many of them and sold off the survivors to Ramun for the galleys.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_11|he said he heard in the Laria market that the Jatu killed some forest bandits who tried to join them. Funny that the Jatu should show a little good taste!
str_rumor_talki_bandit_12|he heard from a farmer outside Rane that when Saffrongate was raided, there were outcasts mixed in with the marauding Mystmountain Raiders. Trash recruits trash, as I always say.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_13|he heard from one of those galley slaves Ramun peddles that {playername} refuses to ransom {reg63?his:her} bandit captives after a battle. {reg63?He:She} says they deserve be sold to the galleys, for the misery they cause the peasants.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_14|he heard from a Pathani horse merchant that one of the D'Shar Khans has taken to impaling bandits outside the Singal walls. That should discourage them from preying on the villagers there! Makes me twitchy to think on it!
str_rumor_talki_bandit_15|he said a lot of the Adventuring Companies are delighted that the bandits have gotten so bold. They are making a pile escorting caravans all over Pendor, and selling off the bandits they catch on top of that.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_16|he says the price of velvet is up by 50%, because the traders have to pay so many guards to get their caravans here safely. They pass the cost right on to the customer, too.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_17|he heard a right sad story from a young bandit the other day. Seems his father died, and his uncle managed to get hold of the farm. His mother had to sell herself into bonded labor just to eat. The lad turned bandit, of course.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_18|he heard in the Fierdsvain that the Heretics sacrifice the bandit members of their bands when they fail to catch enough peasants to satisfy that bloodthirsty goddess of theirs.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_19|he heard a really funny story about some bandits! Seems they tried to take on Meregan Kierlic and the Griffonsword Company by mistake. They only spotted the first few riders and attacked, then the rest of the company appeared and wiped them out.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_20|he said the Vanskerry Raiders grab bandits to sell as thralls up North. Serves the gits right, though I doubt they make very good thralls. Probably steal their owners blind.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_21|he heard from a Gosbur peasant that after that long winter last year, many farmers had been unable to plant at the proper time. Due to the Lord's greed and their high taxes, they weren't sure they'd get through the next winter. Some spoke of abandoning their land and running south to Sarleon. A few of the younger lads have turned bandit, of course.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_22|he saw a woman in Buillin weeping over the body of a young man. Other peasants were standing around watching, and when he asked what had happened, they replied that after the woman lost her husband, their eldest son turned to banditry to support the family. He'd robbed several caravans, and when word got to Titus Legatus about his doings, justice was swift and merciless.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_23|he overheard some bandits planning their next raid. They mentioned the names of several nearby villages, but then one suggested that instead of simply raiding, they ride into the village and turn it into their own personal kingdom. The rest cheered this idea along, overjoyed at the thought of becoming lords. In reality, they were all still just boys.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_24|he said he found a wanted poster by the side of the road. At first he thought it was a picture of a missing child, since the boy looked to be no more than thirteen. On closer inspection, he realized the lord had offered a hefty reward for the head of that kid. Apparently, he was a common bandit and had already killed a dozen men.
str_rumor_talki_bandit_25|he heard a bard sing the Ballad of Tonky Smith. Apparently, it was a favorite in the local tavern, as within minutes the crowd was jeering and singing along discordantly. The ballad told the story of Tonky, the son of a blacksmith that turned to banditry in pursuit of fame and fortune. He ravaged the countryside and swilled wine like water, only to be cut down by {playername}, who did not even know his name.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_1|he heard from a passing caravan that one of the Rogue Knight warbands cut the throats of all the men in a Ravenstern village. And why? Because they didn't like the food they'd stolen from the peasants.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_2|he heard in the Senderfall tavern that someone helped out a Ravenstern Lord in a fight with some Renegade Knights. Now the Knights are out to get that person, name of {playername}. Is that you, by chance? If so, beware!
str_rumor_talki_renegade_3|he said that, according to a Squire who deserted from one of their companies, anyone who gets between the Renegade Knights and their victims is instantly classified as a sworn enemy. And they never forget an enemy.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_4|he heard that most of the Rogue Knights are actually outlawed nobles from foreign lands. They come here to make their fortunes off our current unsettled state, like buzzards circling a dying dog.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_5|he heard from the Valonbray armorer that a group of Renegade Knights tangled with one of the Adventure Companies, and came off badly in that battle. It might have been the Ironsword Company they fought.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_6|he said he had heard that the Renegade Knights badly abuse the peasant women they capture, as well as the apprentice boys in the caravans they take. What perverts those sods must be! I guess they get hard up, since even the whores avoid them if possible.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_7|he heard from a Caravan Master that a group of Renegade Knights mixed it up with some Heretics in the Fierdsvain, and killed off the lot. That is the only good thing I ever heard about Renegade Knights.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_8|he said he heard in Sarleon that even the Lords avoid fighting with the Renegade Knights. Those are some mean bastards, but they are fierce warriors, all right.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_9|he said a trader told him that a pack of Rogue Knights massacred some refugees near Marleons, just for the fun of it. They left the bodies piled up for any passers-by to trip over.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_10|he heard from a friend in Avendor that there was a new group of Renegade Knights, led by the younger son of some Pendor Lord. His father outlawed him for trying to poison his older brother, the heir. The little sod deserved it, if that story is true.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_11|he said he had heard in the Ravenstern market that King Gregory gives a big reward to anyone who brings him the head of a Renegade Knight. They surely are a plague in Ravenstern these days.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_12|he heard an Empire Captain say that Marius told his Legionnaires to kill every band of Rogue Knights they ran across. He says they are nearly as evil as the Snake Cultists.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_13|he said that one of the Renegade Knights claims to be a former member of the Order of the Dragon, and is out to avenge the unlawful disbanding of his Order.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_14|he heard Ramun say that the peasant women he bought from some Renegade Knights were abused to the point of mindlessness and totally unfit for resale.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_15|he said the Sarleon seneschal told him that King Ulric ran away from a group of Renegade Knights. The King was hunting with a small group of nobles and did not want to risk defeat or capture.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_16|he heard in the tavern that a captured Renegade Knight got away from the Red Brotherhood and is looking for someone named {playername} to avenge his defeat. If that is you, be careful!
str_rumor_talki_renegade_17|he said he heard from a Sarleon trader that the Noldor whipped a band of Renegade Knights near Laria, and killed off all the wounded on the spot. It serves those bastards right. Good for the Noldor, I say.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_18|he heard from a Legionnaire that a band of Renegade Knights raided a village near Cez, and set the place on fire when they were done with the women.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_19|he said the Poinsbruk abbot told him that the Rogue Knights are mostly from Pendor, not from foreign lands as they claim, but they pretend to be foreign to disguise their origins. Hard to believe any of them care about family honor, though.
str_rumor_talki_renegade_20|he said that he heard in Janos that some of the Renegade Knight warbands would fight against the Empire on the side of the Snake Cult, if they happened upon a battle between the two. Afterwards, they turn on the winner, of course.
str_rumor_talki_special_1|he said that he met a wandering minstrel who told him that the grave of the mad prophet Madigan is covered in flowers which never wither or die.
str_rumor_talki_special_2|he met a wanderer who told him tales of a mysterious, well-hidden mine guarded by crazy old men. One is said to be a master smith who forges wondrous weapons, and the other seems to have a penchant for wine.
str_rumor_talki_special_3|he heard that there are trainers who will help sharpen the skills of warriors not yet worth their salt.
str_rumor_talki_special_4|he met a merchant who said that he would pay 3000 denars for the Tear of a Dragon. He had no idea what the man was talking about, as there are no living dragons in Pendor. Besides, everyone knows that Dragons cannot cry.
str_rumor_talki_special_5|he had a conversation with several mercenaries in the tavern. They all agreed that if the wars keep getting worse, food will become scarce. There are too many farmers in the army and not enough in the fields.
str_rumor_talki_special_6|he said he had visited a weapons merchant the other day and was stunned to see a Masterwork Noldor Runesword for sale. The merchant wanted more denars for it than his whole town makes in a year!
str_rumor_talki_special_7|he said that he had noticed a lot more foreigners in Pendor in the last six months. They seem to be arriving en masse and disembarking at Valonbray.
str_rumor_talki_special_8|he said that he was approached by a mercenary in a tavern the other day. The man offered to sell him a treasure map.
str_rumor_talki_special_9|who whispered to me over a tankard of ale about the true origins of the Snake Cult in Pendor! He claimed a women named Laorea founded the Cult due to disappointment in her second husband, as she still mourned the first.
str_rumor_talki_special_10|when we camped that night, he sang the sad tale of Hadarac Tanis, the Fire of the Steppes, how he fought and perished in D'Shar lands.
str_rumor_talki_special_11|he was talking about the Order of the Griffon and how Calathar the First refounded it.
str_rumor_talki_special_12|and when we took out our pipes and lit up for a smoke, the story he told was the grim tale of Arbogast of Walven. I did not sleep well that night.
str_rumor_talki_special_13|he said his grandsire fought in the Great Battle of Rane in 327 with the father of Hendrik the Cruel, and saved the Heir of Rane from those heathen savages. Though Hendrik became famous, his sire was was a drunken sot who was ultimately hanged.
str_rumor_talki_special_14|he boasted in the Old Oak Tavern that the merest mention of the name of Durak to any of the Red Brotherhood scum sends them running, crying for their mothers.
str_rumor_talki_special_15|he told me he heard a bard singing the tale of Echilon, a brave old warrior, who died of his wounds after winning his last battle in the snows of Ravenstern.
str_rumor_talki_special_16|and he said that some simpleton, name of Noosers, said he had seen the Fish Knight! No one has seen him for ages!
str_rumor_talki_special_17|he said that after having too much ale, he told the story how of Marius I was captured by Hendrik the Cruel. That is a story best not told in earshot of the Empire.
str_rumor_talki_special_18|he sang his latest song for me  the Ballad of Chase. That story of murder will never go down well in any court, but I liked it the better for that.
str_rumor_talki_special_19|he said he had seen a horse like Darkstar. Unfortunately, he did not have the coin to purchase it. I was unsurprised, given his weakness for high-stakes gambling.
str_rumor_talki_special_20|he said he had heard the tale of Corey the Slave, who used foul sorcery to find water. Sorcerers and magicians should be burned at the stake, for the good of us all!
str_rumor_talki_special_21|he told of a night not long ago, when The Fish Knight shared their fire. They did not recognize him until after he left, the dafties.
str_rumor_talki_special_22|he spoke of the strange habits of the Windtooth tribe in D'Shar lands  I prefer not to repeat them in mixed company.
str_rumor_talki_special_23|he said he heard the Vanskerry Raiders worshipped an enigmatic deity. Those heathen savages hail something called a Saxon Dragon. Everyone knows there are no dragons alive today.
str_rumor_talki_special_24|he said he heard those gossiping monks over at the temple discussing the writings of some old bat of an elder, called Fawzia, who is a scribe and former rug merchant.
str_rumor_talki_special_25|he said he had gawped in awe at the latest work of Alan the Armorer, but could never hope to afford it!
str_rumor_talki_special_26|he related a touching tale of Lord Filadh, who found a baby girl in the ruins of one of his looted villages. His medic healed her, and Lord Filadh raised her as his daughter. He kept her in seclusion to hide her terrible scars.
str_rumor_talki_special_27|he said a Vanskerry Raider walked into the Valonbray tavern, and the barkeep tells him he looks just terrible. The Vankskerry says, 'What do you mean? I feel fine.' 'Well, what about that new wooden leg?' 'A Fierdsvain Huscarl got me with an axe.' 'And the hook where your hand used to be?' 'I was in a sword fight and lost my hand, so I was fitted with this hook.' 'What about the eye patch?' 'A flock of gulls flew over our longship. I made the mistake of looking up, and one of the gulls shat in my eye.' 'You lost your eye from seagull shit?' 'Well, I'd only had the hook for two days... '
str_rumor_talki_special_28|he said a Sarleon Lord was leaving for a siege and told his seneschal, 'Here is the key to my wife's chastity belt. If I do not return within a month, you may use this key to free her of it.' The lord set out on the dusty road, armored from head to toe. He took one last look at his castle and saw his seneschal rushing after him, yelling, 'Stop! Stop! Thank goodness I was able to catch you. This is the wrong key.'
str_rumor_talki_special_29|he said a bard told him that an Empire Legion returned to Janos with prisoners and lots of loot from their victories. 'Tell me of your battles,' said Marius Imperator. 'Well, Sire, we have been winning on your behalf for weeks, burning and pillaging the villages of your enemies in the west.' Old Marius was horrified. 'But I have no enemies in the west at present!' he said. 'Well,' said the Legionnaires, 'you have now.'
str_rumor_talki_special_team_1|he heard there was a D'Shar named Haji Vader, who went mad from something called 'coding' - do you know what that is? Sounds like some D'Shar perversion to me, since it has 'cod' in it.
str_rumor_talki_special_team_2|he said a poor young Sarleon squire plunged into an abyss to escape being buggered by the lord's hangman. Something about that story really bugged me.
str_rumor_talki_special_team_3|he was told about a young fellow named Endymion, a handsome shepherd caught mooning his sheep. Must have been from Ravenstern - you know their reputation with sheep there.
str_rumor_talki_special_team_4|he said a man named Camus told him about his essay called 'Le Mythe de Sysyphe' that was written in some kind of froggy gibberish. How absurd!
str_rumor_talki_special_team_5|he heard there was a new bandit on the loose named Talon, an older feller with an aquiline nose. Keep an eye out for him, he's rumored to be a dangerous caffeine addict.
str_rumor_talki_special_team_6|he said if your jakes are overflowing, you should call in a specialist in bog work named Gerhart. He's famous all over Pendor for being a real professional at that kind of job.
str_rumor_talki_special_team_7|he said the garrison had a new bowman with a really strange name, Chicky-sicky, or something like that. He's supposed to be pretty good with his bow, in spite of that odd name.
str_rumor_talki_special_team_8|he said there was a priest of Astraea, Father James, who regularly lands himself in trouble through preaching things nobody understands. Priests are full of odd sayings, and their words are as twisty as a python.
str_rumor_talki_special_team_9|he said that fellow Mordred spent all his time thinking, and that he'd drown you in details if you let him. He says nothing is ever uncomplicated to that young man, though he's asked him time and again to try and keep things simple.
str_rumor_talki_special_team_10|he said he'd caught an ermine in his rabbit trap and the critter started speaking in different tongues. He must have been drunk as a lord to think that could have happened!
str_rumor_talki_special_team_11|he told me about a quiet armorer who is an utter perfectionist. His armor could have been made by the angels themselves! Unfortunately, he is relocating to a far-away land populated by felons and Pendor will soon be deprived of his skills.
str_rumor_talki_myst_1|he told me that another village militia had been lost to raiders. That makes two this week! Something has to be done we have not had Mystmountain incursions this bad since the Siege of Rane.
str_rumor_talki_myst_2|he said a caravan out of Poinsbruk had been hit by Mystmountain raiders and Jatu horsemen at the same time! He said he would not term it an alliance, though Seems that once the caravan guards were taken out, they fought each other over the spoils!
str_rumor_talki_myst_3|he asked if I had heard anything from Ismirala lately. Apparently there are rumors of vast hordes of Mystmountain raiders forming in the east. They will probably sweep in from the ranges, like they did in 199, slaughtering, raping and burning everything from here to Falcondark. So, another drink, {playername}?
str_rumor_talki_myst_4|he told me he happened to be present when the last batch of Mystmountain prisoners was brought in by the militia. They were bloody, beaten, foul-smelling brutes to be sure, but do you know what he said? They were smiling. Shackled in chains, headed for the dungeons and smiling.
str_rumor_talki_myst_5|he noticed some old Mystmountain knickknacks I once collected. So, I had to tell him all about my days as a manhunter  yup  those were the days. Hunting men, you know, because that is what we real manhunters did, you know, all the time. What? No, you may not see them. They are, um being cleaned.
str_rumor_talki_myst_6|he seemed nervous, always looking over his shoulder. He asked if I had seen anyone named {playername}. I never heard of anyone by that name, so I told him no. He seemed right pleased to hear that and said he would be hiding behind a house in some village or other, if I wanted him.' Oddest thing. 
str_rumor_talki_myst_7|he heard the Sheriff talking to some manhunters, and they were not happy. They said the raiders have been seen massing north of Taloncrag, and the garrison there has been clamoring for reinforcements. When the blow falls, it will land there, mark my words.
str_rumor_talki_myst_8|he met a bent, old Mystmountain man on his last trip. They were heading in the same direction, so they walked together in silence. The old fellow looked up as they passed Silveredge Keep and said, 'Vejovis knows'. Only thing he said the whole way.
str_rumor_talki_myst_9|he ran into a mountainman who looked shaken. he said he had seen that cat, Vejovis, on the mountain. He figured the mountainman was drunk again, but there was no smell of wine on him. He told the man those Vejovis tales were naught but legend and besides, only shamans supposedly see Vejovis. And then the old mountainman turned his face. Clawed from brow to jawline, he was.
str_rumor_talki_myst_10|he told me the raids are picking up. Bigger and bigger hordes of Mystmountains are pouring out of the crags. Somewhere, someone is organizing the clans. There is no other explanation, unless you believe in that Vejovis nonsense.
str_rumor_talki_myst_11|he said he wanted to. Hey, are you {playername}? Listen, whatever Aaron told you is not true. I had nothing to do with it. Pretending to be Vejovis outside that cottage was all his idea, and his doing. Funny as hell, though
str_rumor_talki_myst_12|he wanted to know if I had heard anyone asking about herds of horses. I had not, of course, but I was curious as to why he asked. So then he tells me that raiders have taken the entire stock from three horse farms in the last week alone and there is only one reason for that. They're coming, and soon.
str_rumor_talki_myst_13|he mentioned seeing a young Mystmountain lad in the tavern last night. Seemed bright and cheerful, really. There was no trouble at first. But then old Brice got drunk and started bragging about killing raiders. And you know what? The kid just smiled. 'Vejovis knows' was all he said.
str_rumor_talki_myst_14|he said he had seen the god manifest. Taloncrag, Silveredge, Alden all the border forts are stockpiling food, weapons, and fresh-faced youngsters. I never asked him how he had come to see it. Doubt he would tell me anyway, but he never steered me wrong before. The lords know. The cat is awake.
str_rumor_talki_myst_15|he told me a caravan master had brought him some troubling news. Jatu horsemen and Mystmountain raiders have been joining forces in the east. I dunno if they have an actual alliance, or if was just convenient, but travel to Poinsbruk has gotten rather chancy.
str_rumor_talki_myst_16|he said he was taking in some air last night, when he saw a group of people moving swiftly and silently past him in the darkness. They seemed to be heading in the general direction of town. The only sound he heard was the distant yowling of a mountain cat.
str_rumor_talki_myst_17|he heard a group of caravan guards arguing with the master. They wanted more money and they demanded he hire more guards. You watch, prices are going to go up on everything. Bloody Mystmountains refuse to leave well enough alone. Who will chase them back into their caves this time? That's what I'd like to know.
str_rumor_talki_myst_18|he told me that another caravan has been lost to raiders. That is not all that unlikely in this day and age, but this caravan? It was south of Balanli. That is further than they have ever struck before. At this rate they will end up bringing in those leaf-eating Noldor! And here's us, nicely caught smack in the middle.
str_rumor_talki_myst_19|he told me to be on the lookout for you, {playername}. Apparently, you are a popular topic of Mystmountain conversations. And, it is not because of your winning personality, if ya take my meaning.
str_rumor_talki_myst_20|he said he had just returned from a successful campaign against the Mystmountain Raiders that have been plaguing Dugan. Did you know the Mystmountains never eat meat? Their whole diet consists of horsemilk cheese and coarse bread. Figure they leave the meat for Vejovis, or something.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_1|he said some Barclay traders he met when they first landed in Javiksholm left there with the intention of buying Noldor artifacts, but were waylaid by the Jatu and killed.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_2|he heard a trader say that the Noldor resent the fact that they have to sell their goods to humans. They think their crafts are too good for our kind, I guess.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_3|he said he overheard Ramun say that when he gets hold of a Noldor woman, she never goes up for public sale. He puts Noldor gals into his 'private stock,' reserved for his best class of customer, and gets bushels of denars for them.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_4|he heard in Janos that one of the Empire Lords rescued some Noldor Rangers from a band of Snake Cultists, and has enlisted them into his warband. What a lucky dog he is! With them on his walls, his castle is safe as houses from besiegers.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_5|he heard from a captured thief that a Sarleon Lord bought a Noldor Maiden Ranger from the Red Brotherhood and keeps her locked up in his castle tower. I wonder what his lady wife thinks of that.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_6|he heard from a courtier that Emperor Marius tried to hire some Noble Noldor Knights the Legion saved from the Snake Cult and they spat on his offer, laughed in his face and went back to their woods.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_7|he heard in Ethos that a musician there is willing to pay a fortune for a Noldor flute, but cannot find one to purchase.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_8|he heard a troubadour playing a Noldor lute, and said it had the loveliest tone he had ever heard drawn from a string.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_9|he said he had heard in Laria that the Noldor took out another lot of Jatu. I guess the Noldor are useful once in a while, in spite of themselves.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_10|he heard in the Empire that the Legionnaires hate fighting the Noldor, because the casualties are so high, even if they outnumber the Noldor three to one.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_11|he heard the Noldor are venturing further into the Empire, chasing groups of Snakes. I pray they get them all, but that is too much to hope for!
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_12|he heard that the Noldor enlist peasants freed from the bandits and Jatu they kill, and even sneak into the Empire to recruit, when the Lords are not looking.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_13|he heard a rumor that the Noldor are backing some new Warlord, who hates Jatu even more than he detests the rest of us humans.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_14|he said a Sarleon Halberdier told him he would rather face fifty Jatu than ten Noldor Rangers. He says they never miss their targets and can shoot from a greater distance than a Sarleon Longbowman.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_15|he heard some collector in Rane was paying serious money for any Noldor artifacts he could get his hands on.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_16|he said the traders are unable to procure enough Noldor goods these days. The Noldor are keeping more to themselves and even refusing to trade with their usual buyers.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_17|he heard of an auction sale in Laria that is invitation only, restricted to Lords. They have to put up a deposit of 1000 denars just to get in the door. The Red Brotherhood is selling some Noldor Maiden Rangers to the highest bidders.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_18|he said the Red Brotherhood bought a Noldor Ranger from some deserters, but the Ranger got his hands on a sword, killed six of the Redboys and escaped. They are still mourning their lost profit on him, no doubt.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_19|he heard a mercenary from the Fierdsvain declare in the Laria tavern that he would prefer to take on ten Valkyries in a fight, as opposed to a pair of Noldor Maiden Rangers. He said he might survive a fight with the Valkyries.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_20|he heard in Poinsbruk that the Noldor fought a great battle with the Jatu, and that both sides were hurt badly, but the Noldor won in the end.
str_rumor_talki_noldor1_21|he said it is rumored that there is a secret passage into the hidden Noldor city, but nobody has ever found it.
str_rumor_talki_trav_1|he said the life of a traveler is never dull. His work as a miller grew confining and he never got out of his village. One day, he sold his mill and took to the road.
str_rumor_talki_trav_2|he said there are certain stones which are, in fact, the tears of a dragon. He set out to try to acquire one for himself. You don't happen to have one, do you? Ah never mind, the gems are doubtless just some hopeless fantasy.
str_rumor_talki_trav_3|he said the Noldor are a most interesting people, but very secretive. He wants to locate a group of them and write a book about their culture.
str_rumor_talki_trav_4|he said that I would be better off traveling and talking to people in order to get information for my book, 'The Mysterious Musings of a Marvelous Mystic'. It is a collection of the wisdom of one known as Madigan.
str_rumor_talki_trav_5|he said that the Snake Priestesses were young girls taken from villages by the Snake Cult. My own daughter was stolen in such a raid and I roam Pendor seeking her.
str_rumor_talki_trav_6|he said I should join the army. I'd rather be sailing, but I get really sea-sick. Even thinking about the rolling, rocking sea is making me... Bluuuugh!
str_rumor_talki_trav_7|he said that knowledge is power. I have read more books than most people know exist. Now I am a student of life of the road, learning from the common folk and their tales.
str_rumor_talki_trav_8|he said he asked him, 'What is your quest?' The man replied that he wished to find the average flight velocity of an unladen swallow.
str_rumor_talki_trav_9|he talked of the final words of his father. My own expressed his disappointment at not having seen the world beyond his farm. He made me promise to journey the length and breadth of Pendor and recount to him my adventures when I join him in the afterlife.
str_rumor_talki_trav_10|he said... acorn, almond, beech, cashew... he knew a Knight of the Radiant Cross with the biggest list of nuts in Pendor. Chestnut, coconut, hazelnut, hickory, macadamia... So I bet that... Ogbono, paradisenut, peanut... mine was the larger list. My colleagues however think I have gone a little nuts.
str_rumor_talki_trav_11|he said he followed the mantra of Veni, Vici, Vidi. I myself follow the mantra of Veni, Vici, Peregrinus. I came, I saw, I wandered.
str_rumor_talki_trav_12|he said one must wander the world to appreciate its varied marvels. I travel not for its beauty but rather to observe how it change us.
str_rumor_talki_trav_13|he said a piece of the sky fell near here. I came to discover if it was the folly of man or the will of the gods which caused it.
str_rumor_talki_trav_14|he said that the goddess Erida Occisor had awakened! The end of the world is nigh! We are all doomed! Doomed, I tell you!
str_rumor_talki_trav_15|he said he sometimes felt the invisible tug of a hand guiding his actions. Personally, I feel an omnipresent authority figure moving me like a pawn in the game of life.
str_rumor_talki_trav_16|he said a wise man once told him to talk to everyone he met. Much valuable information can be gleaned from idle tavern conversations and gossip in the markets.
str_rumor_talki_trav_17|he said a captain he knew had actually purchased a Knight in a tavern. He was being held for ransom by the Red Brotherhood, and his cost was remarkably cheap.
str_rumor_talki_trav_18|he said the man was marvelously strong and vigorous, due to an elixir he'd purchased from some wandering fellow. Cost him a Qualis Gem, but was worth it.
str_rumor_talki_trav_19|he said the village militias often know more than they let on about enemies in their area. If they like you, they will tip you off as to where they are.
str_rumor_talki_trav_20|he heard that when an Empire lord vanquished somebody called Maltise, he got something called a 'qualis gem' in ransom. I wonder what it is and what he can do with it.
str_rumor_talki_trav_21|he heard there was a mine somewhere run by a couple of strange old fellows. One is a weaponsmith and the other is a crazy old drunk. He won't even talk to you unless you give him wine.
str_rumor_talki_trav_22|he said he'd refused to pay 10 denars for rumors from a traveler, and lived to regret it. His caravan was overrun by a Mystmountain army the very next day. Now, he pays 10 denars gladly to hear the news.
str_rumor_talki_trav_23|he talked about the hidden chests in a couple of towns and said he'd bought a map to find one of them. It wasn't there but now, the fool is looking for the man who has the map to the other one. He thinks he might get some kind of gem out of it.
str_rumor_talki_trav_24|he said that gambling with guild masters was risky if you lost, but very profitable if you won.
str_rumor_talki_trav_25|he said that the training fields were an underused benefit to all warriors. Everybody, regardless of experience, needs to keep his hand in!
str_rumor_talki_trav_26|he told him that no man worth his salt would disdain conversation with the arms instructors in the training fields. Their conversation is frequently spicy, too!
str_rumor_talki_trav_27|he said he'd heard the old gods of Pendor sometimes speak when they have a message to deliver, but I never met anybody they had spoken to. Claptrap, I say.
str_rumor_talki_trav_28|he said a sea captain told him about some island called Veccavi, where the women run everything and the men are slaves. Did you ever hear of such a thing?
str_rumor_talki_trav_29|he heard in the Empire whispers of an escaped Snake Priestess now at large in Pendor. There was some sort of power dust-up in whatever their hierarchy was, and she was on the losing side.
str_rumor_talki_trav_30|he was told that rumors have more weight than most people think. Sometimes, it seems as if the rumor presages the event. Odd thing, that.
str_player_ask_drag_1|I was very curious to learn something about your order, if you don't mind?
str_player_ask_lion_1|I'm sure the great and famous Knights of the Lion have a history?
str_player_ask_immo_1|I would like to know the origins of your legendary order.
str_player_ask_wind_1|Swift rider of the desert, what can you tell me of your famous order?
str_player_ask_valk_1|Surely the Valkyrie Sisterhood has some history to share with me?
str_player_ask_grif_1|Grand knight of the old kingdom, care to tell me about your order?
str_player_ask_falc_1|They say that your order was banned by King Gregory.
str_player_ask_rave_1|I thought that the Order of the Raven Spear was composed of scholars?
str_player_ask_radi_1|If you wouldn't mind, may you tell me some history of your order?
str_player_ask_clar_1|Why does your order choose to use horse archers?
str_player_ask_dawn_1|People say that your order is dedicated to the elimination of evil ...?
str_player_ask_ebon_1|Who exactly are the Knights of the Ebony Gauntlet?
str_player_ask_shad_1|Why do you use cavalry for some Empire troops, but not for the higher ranks?
str_player_ask_silv_1|Word has it that your order admires the Noldor - can you tell me more?
str_player_ask_even_1|I understand that your Order split from the Order of Dawn. What caused the rift?
str_player_ask_phoe_1|You don't look like most knights around here good sir, where do you hail from?
str_player_ask_wolf_1|Dear dark knight, what can you tell me about your order?
str_player_ask_scor_1|Fearsome warrior of the D'Shar, could you tell me about your order?
str_player_ask_krak_1|Do the intimidating Kraken Cultists have a history?
str_drag_response_1|I can indulge ya, if you're willing to part ways with some of that delicious ale in your baggage train! - Sips donated drink - Now let's see ... Ah yes I remember, It was the 199th year of Pendor, or was it 200 ... Anyway, glorious Earl Klovis, liege of Rane, was the order's founding Grandmaster. While I can't exactly remember -why- the order was founded, I believe the scribes from Poinsbruk stated that it had something to do with the Siege of Rane when the royal family died off not a few short years before.
str_lion_response_1|Hmph, I suppose I can indulge you. Better than lending my ears to the tales of the dirty peasantry. I belong to one of the oldest orders in Pendor, if not the oldest itself. The order was founded no less than 90 years, 82 to be exact, after the founding of the first Kingdom of Pendor. The gallant knight, Sir Roderick the Red, Lions Mane himself, was our founder. You may look him up at your own leisure.
str_immo_response_1|You're the first one to have gall to approach me and ask, so I'll indulge. The Immortals started off as more of a ... secret service ...in direct contact of the current Overlord, Imperator Marius I. This is according to our founding charter created by Marius who signed the Validus Charta. The order itself is v ery young and we don't have much history. But I can tell you we are the toughest bastards the Empire has to offer.
str_wind_response_1|Hello traveler. It seems the blowing winds have made us cross paths, no? -Chuckles- I am indeed a Windrider. Representative of the strongest the D'Shar nobility have to offer. Our horses have been bred to maintain composure when fighting on the wind-shaped dunes in the desert and to transverse great distances. Believe it or not we were once a sect of assassins born from a similar cloth like the brotherhood of Scorpion Assassins. So happens through many generations that we developed our own identity to combat our enemies on the field.
str_valk_response_1|Hello. As you may have guessed, I am indeed part of the Valkyrie Sisterhood. Our lineage is traced through Fierdsvain nobility and Vanskerry blood. Our order originated from women who traveled with Vanskerry raid parties to Pendor. We were shield-maidens on the field and property in the camps ...
str_grif_response_1|Greetings. I am glad you noticed my orders ancient sigil, The Griffon. With the revival of our order, we have set out to hear the voices of the people; to bring peace and order to the land which we all share.
str_falc_response_1|True, my friend, but we have a past in which we take pride. Our original company, which founded the order, was formed by the Validus Charta. It was not disbanded until King Gregory betrayed us and his sister. We are also the only order to allow both men and women to fight in ranks.
str_rave_response_1|We are, but due to incursions from the Mystmountain armies on our university strongholds, we were forced to take up arms to defend wisdom and civilization.
str_radi_response_1|Of course, I would be delighted to shed some light on our orders history! The creation of our order in 113, by Baron Jorn of Dunglave, now known as Janos, is an interesting tale. Back then we were known as Medicine-Men. The state of medicinal knowledge and practice in Pendor was abysmal in the beginning years of our founding. Subsections of our signed Validus Charta charter allowed our members to proliferate the cities, fiefs, towns, with knowledge of medical advancements from Amala. From various herbal concoctions to simple remedies for the average ache of the head. The order was the bedrock foundation for the curb of pestilence and disease.
str_clar_response_1|We are a highly mobile force which patrols and secures our borders. We need to move fast to locate and harass our enemies. This is the way the nobility of Laria has learned to fight. While the Lions of Sarleon have their rolling plains, the Knights of the East must adapt to the forest and the steppes. Many of the Larian nobility fight this way; have you seen the Larian Sentinels? Some of them are young nobles from Laria who wish to fight like us, instead of those pompous Lions. We may fight like the D'Shar, which is the best for most situations, but that does not mean we forego the traditional ways of knightly battle. We still bear spear and sword with pride and skill.
str_dawn_response_1|Our sworn mission is to root out evil; our swords and lances are the instruments of Astraea. When we strike down a sinner, we are doing the sanctified work of the Goddess. She has blessed us, even in this godforsaken place. Soldiers of the Fierdsvain, foot-knights and commoners have converted and flocked to our holding in Valonbray. They now serve us under the banner of the now defunct order of the Wyvern. The Wyverns protected their land long ago, and now our new Wyverns fight to protect Pendor from evil. They may be barbarians, but they fight well enough.
str_ebon_response_1|We exist to serve the greater good of the whole of humanity, though I suppose that sounds a bit pompous. We consider ourselves above petty matters and politics, the squabbles of kings and queens.
str_shad_response_1|Our Ironbred stallions date to the old days of the Empire. They are strong, very fast and aid us in swiftly crushing our enemies. We value them highly, but they are difficult to breed and train, so our supply of them is limited.
str_silv_response_1|Yes, our order holds them in great admiration. There is enough space in Pendor for us all to live in peace with one another. We can learn much from them, but also they are a force to be reckoned with, I can tell you!
str_even_response_1|The Order of Dawn is riddled with fanatics whose twisted beliefs and violence against the populace are despicable. We split from them because they are rotten to the core.
str_phoe_response_1|I come from across the sea, the great continent of Amala. My order is known as The Order of the Phoenix.
str_wolf_response_1|...
str_scor_response_1|I can indeed bring you up to speed of whom we are. Like the soft eroding sands of the Shavanir Desert, we slowly infiltrate our way into the world. We are men bound by creed and secrecy, loyal to those who would support our brotherhood. We are whom you come to if you have a problem that is lawfully out of your hands. Our only incentive is the gleaming shine of coin. For there is no greater employer than man's folly for wealth, which breeds conflict, and for us, work.
str_krak_response_1|I will let you know -some- things. Many of us are several generations of combat-trained hunters and fishermen. We take our prey from the sea to provide for our people and to make a livelyhood from the demand of our bounty. We also contract out our members as hired work for our Lords. We get our hands dirty so to speak. There is always an off-season for the hunt so we do what we do naturally, kill.
str_player_ask_drag_2|Huh, sounds like the history is a bit lost in mystery. Are you sure you can't remember more?
str_player_ask_lion_2|So what is some more history of your old order?
str_player_ask_immo_2|Interesting! I didn't know the order was so young. What kind of services did Marius ask of?
str_player_ask_wind_2|You were all assassins at one time? How did that work with The Scorpion Assassins?
str_player_ask_valk_2|You come from a solely male-dominated society, how did your order overcome that social barrier?
str_player_ask_grif_2|What can you tell me about your newly created order? What do you hope to achieve?
str_player_ask_falc_2|Could you elaborate on how you allow both genders?
str_player_ask_rave_2|A pack of ancient scholars don platemail and equip swords to stand against barbarians?
str_player_ask_radi_2|That's truly amazing! Pray tell you have more to share?
str_player_ask_clar_2|Why is your order called the Knights of the Clarion Call?
str_player_ask_dawn_2|How do you determine who is guilty and who is innocent?
str_player_ask_ebon_2|I see. What of the Noldor then?
str_player_ask_shad_2|Please excuse my question, but why is your Order at odds with the Radiant Cross?
str_player_ask_silv_2|They say that few bowmen can shoot a arrow as far as a Silvermist - what's your secret?
str_player_ask_even_2|So what caused Barclay to ban them? What did they do?
str_player_ask_phoe_2|I can't imagine a world bigger than Pendor. What more can you tell me about your order?
str_player_ask_wolf_2|Um, sir?
str_player_ask_scor_2|That is certainly good to know ... how does your order operate?
str_player_ask_krak_2|That's quite the background. If that is the case, why is your order associated as a cult?
str_drag_response_2|- Drinks from mug - AH! Yes I remember a bit more now! The Siege of Rane caused the lords of the old kingdom to secede and form the Kingdom of Ravenstern, after the capital. The lords of the north came together and signed the infamous Validus Charta, which is rumored to have consented for the birth of our Order as an official noble-influenced chapter. 
str_lion_response_2|We are renowned for our continuous use of chivalry in battle and etiquette in presenting ourselves as proper nobles in court. Around 200 years after the old kingdom was reigning, the royal family was struck down by a malady, which led to immediate chaos. Our sister order, the Knights of the Griffon, were royal guards of the kingdom and became responsible for maintaining peace. The Lions of course were ordered to as well. This immediate power vacuum started pitting lords against one another, which led to even more conflict.
str_immo_response_2|Anything and everything that involves the Snake Cult. They have masterfully infiltrated the nobility and heart of our Empire and many Empire Lords requested Marius for reform and action. The Immortalem Iuris charter subsection stated that select men are, without question, to pursue and hunt down secret sects and cult meetings. Further more to eradicate any and all traces of cult activites and persons. It turned bloody every time.
str_wind_response_2|When it came to fruition that the Scorpion Assassins have been acting as a household guard for a tribal chief after the death of the old Royal Family, our order was conceived by invoking a land-wide charter at the time. Caliph Itsaf Xer was afraid that he was to be killed by the aspiring and future Khan. Our order were the counter-measure to the numerous assassination attempts that came from the Scorpions. They thwarted many attempts against the Caliph and his family until finally, retaliation was warranted. The Windriders made their way into the rising Khan's camp, guarded by his Scorpion Assassins. They successfully infiltrated the area. The Scorpions let their guard down and didn't notice. So the Windriders thought.
str_valk_response_2|Jarl Gardor Oldboar was a fearsome Vanskerry leader. He brought many of our order ancestors with him on an expedition to the heartland of Pendor. Raid after raid and countless times of being abused and taken as toys to these men in battle and bed, the sisters formed a blood pack amongst themselves. Those shield-maidens swore and oath to never be seen as objects and be used to the great benefit of others. That night they played their roles for the tired Jarls and when the time came, they killed the entire Oldboar Leadership. They raised the alarm and most of them fled together into the hills.
str_grif_response_2|We plan on supporting the leaders of our new Kingdom. With their leadership, The Knights of the Griffon will help pave a new era into prosperity and peace. After the Red Plague and the decimation of the Royal Family we ended up falling into disarray. Our order was fractured by the various battles for power and the successful bid of the Lions and the Duke they supported. We lost all credibility and support. Most of the order went into hiding, mercenary work, trades or just vanished. Our records, except for the documents taken by some of the knights, are all but extinguished from this world. But our original charter has made it clear that our purpose is to solely keep a unified Pendor protected and to make sure chaos does not find it's way into the roots of our land. Descendants of our old order have been showing up almost everyday, ready to put our steel to the test and to follow through where our predecessors failed.
str_falc_response_2|In the past, one of the five original founding members was Valera, a woman of great skill and bravery. The charter allowed our order to be women-only, but Ursula amended that and allowed men to join the ranks. My guess is mainly because there is only so many woman warriors in Pendor. Many join the Valkyries but we will never turn down those who wish to join. Valera never really was questioned on why this was part of our founding charter but I wouldn't trade my fellow knights for the world.
str_rave_response_2|No, not at all. The students and scholars continue our most important work, that of academia. They have always employed groups of adventurers like us to aid their research and discover lost lore. We also fight for them as required.
str_radi_response_2|The increase in overall health throughout the land was incredibly better than at the start of our cause. Then The Red Plague came in 198. Tales say the order had never seen anything so deadly. It was an unstoppable plague that wiped out the Royal family in its entirety and many knighthoods succumbed and collapsed due to so many deaths. We still don't know where this disease came from or why it suddenly appeared. Some records indicate that it bore a resemblance to The Poxaspa Plague used by the Snake Cult over in Amala. Although it is hard to say since many supporting records were destroyed since then and no trace of the disease even exists anymore.
str_clar_response_2|The Clarion Call name stems from our answering the call to protect the frontier, to advance against our enemies, and to demonstrate that those who bear arms against us forfeit their lives.
str_dawn_response_2|After all, every human is guilty of something! When in doubt, we simply burn them all. Our wise goddess will sort them out.
str_ebon_response_2|Filthy tree rats hiding in the shadows. They're like a curse. That Red Plague which damn near ended life in Pendor, came from them, I'd wager. They ever lurk in ambush. Only way to deal with Noldor is a bolt between the eyes.
str_shad_response_2|We accept the true faith of the Old Empire unquestioningly. Those misguided fools of the Radiant Cross are blind and fail to accept our traditional faith. They endlessly question that which we accept upon a leap of faith. We cannot make them see reason.
str_silv_response_2|We learned from the Noldor. They hold that the bow is an extension of the body. They become one with the bow physically and with the arrow mentally. We meditate before battle to achieve this melding of weapon and soul. Some, such as our halberdiers, have even used this philosophy with other weapons.
str_even_response_2|Their paranoia and fanaticism led them to murder for what they deemed blasphemy, and was frequently merely accidental on the part of their victims. They once burned a whole village, lock, stock, and peasants. They burned one of our most revered Brothers at the stake! Their reason? They thought his scholarly research was heretical. Another time, they put a merchant to the stake because he spat in the street when some of them rode by.
str_phoe_response_2|We are true sons of the Ashenborn Empire. Our Emperor, Emperor Marneus Calgar, leads our people from across the sea against the very threat that is strong enough to destroy this world. You know of the Snake Cult. Our name derives from the multitude of Empires that each one has been built upon. From the ashes, the true sons spread their wings and take up arms for each new empire, now, The Ashenborn Empire. We believe that each Empire is stronger than the next, like that of the mythical Phoenix, with each resurrection. Our order is unmatched across the sea and our Emperor has sent us to Imperator Marius to help quell the unrest the Snake Cult has been creating. Unfortunately, we are now tied up in whatever this colonial Empire gets itself into.
str_wolf_response_2|I will tell you little if that makes you go away. Just talking to you is more than I wish to bargain for. I am part of an order known as The Shadow Wolves. Our Emperor from across the sea has sent us here to aid the people. We undergo certain missions to stop the Snake Cult from spreading it's venomous tendrils here. With the Cult lead by Amala's fierce Maltise, this land has got its hands full.
str_scor_response_2|Our order is based in the south where our people live. After the formation of the Principality, we were legally founded as an order under the Validus Charta. Our foundation was funded by Baltar al-eaqarab, one of the few leaders of the tribes competing to rule as Khan of the nomads. Unfortunately, his power and influence weren't as great as the leaders who traded with the northerners. So when the Red Plague wiped out nobility in the year 198, the power vacuum made all the tribe leaders lunge for power in the south. If there was no King, then there must be a Khan. So Baltar thought smart, and hired men to take care of his opposition. He founded the Scorpion Brotherhood as a household guard. Underneath that veil were trained assassins, my ancestors.
str_krak_response_2|Religion or Cult, it boils down to the bone as the same thing, doesn't it? The Dawn like to remind everyone that there's a clear difference, but then again, it's the Dawn. We pray to the Great Hunt. The spirit we conjure form as beasts; found out at sea. They are the ultimate prey and we don't stop our season until one is killed. Each one of our masked helmets are made from the rare materials these creatures provide. We harvest what we need out at sea and return the carcass to the depths below. Sounds grandly exaggerated, but if you saw what we saw, your world would be flipped as you know it.
str_player_ask_drag_3|Why would the Lords choose to support Earl Klovis' and the knights at the time?
str_player_ask_lion_3|That is very insightful. What happened with trying to maintain peace?
str_player_ask_immo_3|What was the immediate response to the reform?
str_player_ask_wind_3|So what happened that night?
str_player_ask_valk_3|That sounds hardly like an order worth joining, how did your order redeem themselves?
str_player_ask_grif_3|Your order seems extremely chivalrous and devoted to the cause of justice and order. What more can you share?
str_player_ask_falc_3|Not to offend you with my question, but why was your Order disbanded?
str_player_ask_rave_3|So you are therefore an Order of mercenaries?
str_player_ask_radi_3|That's quite terrible, hopefully it got better!
str_player_ask_clar_3|I have heard people say that your horses are different from other Pendoran breeds ...?
str_player_ask_dawn_3|I heard that once your Order burned a entire village and all its peasantry?
str_player_ask_ebon_3|Yet some scholars embrace the elder knowledge of the Noldor and claim to have reached enlightenment from it.
str_player_ask_shad_3|I understand that your Order is somewhat at odds with Marius Imperator?
str_player_ask_silv_3|I heard your Order bears a grudge against the Order of the Ebony Gauntlet.
str_player_ask_even_3|I gather then, that your Order's previous affiliation with them is non-existent?
str_player_ask_phoe_3|That is quite an interesting view on your own Empire and the one in Pendor. How does one become a Phoenix Knight?
str_player_ask_wolf_3|I see ... before I leave is there anymore you can tell me?
str_player_ask_scor_3|Your order sounds like it has influenced events in Pendor with your methods of solution.
str_player_ask_krak_3|I see ... anymore I should know?
str_drag_response_3|The conflict with the lower kingdoms was only the beginning of the problems they faced back then. The Mystmountain tribes found them to be more susceptible to attacks and raids as Ravenstern was already at war and standing on its own feet, without southern support. The order was called upon to serve the Kingdom and to quell all unrest that the tribes caused. Let me tell you, the Order gave no mercy to the tribes, which caused them to split exponentially into smaller ones. Which, mind you, is much easier to control than a single tribe.
str_lion_response_3|Many northern lords formed a pact and seceded from the Kingdom. Naturally protected by the great lake, they fortified themselves in the northern tundra, creating a new kingdom of their own. Then with the war against the Greater Baccus Empire, the order needed to start gaining influence with a winning side. The grandmaster at the time supported Duke Alfred of Sarleon as king. Furthermore, he used the old capital as his own, in turn creating the glorious Kingdom of Sarleon. In the year 298, after the original creation of the Pendor Kingdom, our order was outlawed. Why? Hard to say, since all records were destroyed by our current king, King Ulric I. Our order was reestablished once again in the year 346 in Sarleon and we became the household guard of our capital once more.
str_immo_response_3|Like I stated, bloody. While we lost a lot of great men out there, we were mainly successful in rooting out most of the corrupt individuals leading the cults agenda. Cutting the snake's head, as you will. Many were driven out of fiefs and towns; mainly to the south. There are even rumors that they infiltrated nobility in Cez and the nobles there. We found no evidence. Maybe they were just good at hiding it finally ... Now we hunt roaming bands and protect our Lords as law and stature apply. Rest is history to be written.
str_wind_response_3|The Windriders entered the grand tent that was strangely less guarded than anticipated. Eventually coming upon the Khan in his chambers, they had him surrounded and were ready to strike him. Before that, he began laughing. He then quickly glanced to the men who hung from the roof as they descended down and disarmed the Windriders and killing those who resisted. To those who surrendered he offered them something they did not expect; a sit-down with Itsaf himself. With their release, a place was set and the two leaders met and formed an alliance. Itsaf was granted rank of marshal and supported the aspiring Khan. The stipulation was that Itsaf could not claim the right to Khan and that the Windriders either be disbanded or removed from any kind of service to stealth and secrecy. The later was taken. Slowly the order got into skirmishes against other cultures and adopted similar fighting techniques to mounted knights and the rest is history or another story entirely.
str_valk_response_3|Those woman reluctantly came upon a town controlled by a Jarl-Lord. By then, news had spread that Gardor and his raiding warband had been thrown into chaos. The Lord's lands were continuously ravaged by the disgruntled Vanskerries. With the raiding party in disarray, he was in our ancestors' debt. With some strings pulled, he was able to sign off on part of the Validus Charta. Our actions were rewarded with us becoming Valkyries, the Choosers of the Slain. Our charter was created to serve those who are being suppressed and to righteously smite oppressors from existence. While this would clearly put us at odds with the Dawn, we don't feel like creating order warfare with those who have helped our fellow Fierdsvain people. Let us hope that one day we don't choose you. Take care.
str_grif_response_3|We indeed are and we are glad to have been reformed by those with similar values and hopes for a united Pendor. We are now going to give our sister order, The Knights of the Lion, a piece of their traitorous medicine if we ever meet them in combat. They spat on all good that knights stood for and claim to be the oldest and strongest of orders in Pendor. Well, sadly, we will be glad to inform them that is not the case anymore. The time for a united Pendor is now upon us. Let us hope that you have chosen the right side in this upcoming and glorious era.
str_falc_response_3|When King Gregory usurped the throne of his elder sister, Madame Ursula, he claimed that ours was an invalid charter, with no authority to induct his sister, or any knights, into our ranks. He knew that we would support her claim to the throne, and proclaimed Fire and Sword against us to eliminate her threat to his stolen throne. So many of us were killed. Those few of us who survived had to remain underground out of fear for our lives. Our numbers were too few to fight back.
str_rave_response_3|I suppose so, technically, since we primarily fight for pay. We prefer to consider ourselves the paid guardians and defenders of knowledge and the protectors of the scholars who pursue lost knowledge.
str_radi_response_3|At first, it didn't. The order had to become even more militarized since war was rampant throughout Pendor. The order answered the call of the King of Sarleon at the time when General Oasar of Amala came in the year 202. Oasar conquered what little resistance the Sarleon lords could put up. At the battle of Sagen Glade, the order was caught off guard in the opening of a forest. The knights began getting slaughtered. Oasar's army killed every member on the field. Those who stayed in Dunglave survived and when Oasar conquered the city, he refounded the order. Those who refused his regulations were hanged. With the rise in Snake Cult activity after conquering and diseases rampant, the new order was kept busy and recruited more members from any class. Now, we spread knowledge and work with scribes up in Poinsbruk to keep records. We will not stand by as Pendor succumbs under plague. The Snake Cult must be purged.
str_clar_response_3|We prefer faster horses than those heavy warhorses of other Orders, so we breed ours from D'Shar and Jatu stock and trade with their horse dealers for breeding stock.
str_dawn_response_3|That corrupt offshoot Order of Eventide, my friend, spreads its heresy everywhere! They were founded upon hate, and death and hatred is what they preach. Rest assured, we will eliminate them down to the last man. They will burn in payment for their sins! Question me thusly again, and you may find yourself afire!
str_ebon_response_3|Bollocks. The only true enlightenment for a Noldor is the light let into his skull from my morningstar. Till the day they all lay dead, I will fight them. I will stand with my shield brothers, hell, I'll even even stand with the Hammers. They may be dressed up commoners, but they sure can swing those hammers. The sound of one of their hammers crushing a Noldor ranger's head is poetic, to say the least.
str_shad_response_3|Marius seeks to turn us from the old Empire path we follow to the Pendorian ones. Those cretins of the Radiant Cross endorse the new ways but we follow tradition. What brought glory to our ancestors will surely bring glory to us! We would prefer to convert Marius to the old ways, to persuade him that the traditions of the Old Empire should endure. Marius would see us all become mounted knights, like those 'Lions' from Sarleon or the Dawn from Barclay. The only remains of the mighty fleet the Empire used to sail here are the soldiers that we had to train to become the marines you see today.
str_silv_response_3|Look, the last thing Pendor needs is an Order like Ebony Gauntlet. Don't you think there are enough people seeking to feud with the Noldor? When they are done hunting the Noldor, who will they choose next to hunt? Madness of this sort must end!
str_even_response_3|I spit upon their so-called justice and honor! It is nothing more than an excuse for mayhem and senseless slaughter. Astraea granted them no right to sit in judgment upon others. They hunt those they call Heretics but it is they who named us thusly. My Order prefers to look at both sides of the coin, and we do not pass judgment upon ignorant peasants. We prevent the Order of Dawn from persecuting the people!The people themselves are joining us, D'Shar tribals now take up the cause of the Eventide as our Ghilmen. They are no knights, but that sure as hell doesn't stop them from killing any!
str_phoe_response_3|Back home, our order are heir successors from knights who live long enough to produce an heir. From the moment we are old enough, we are trained to ride horse, become smiths, and we train for combat. Our future is laid out by our fathers. Each one of us wear our father's armor as they did before us and so on. Like our beliefs, we renew our armor and make it reborn from heat, ash, and steel. We have had to make due with the fact that we aren't in Amala, so we accept only the strongest this land has to offer. The Phoenix is represented upon our breastplate, so our enemies know whom they face and that each time we are struck down, we only come back stronger.
str_wolf_response_3|... What you need to know is that we are a order bound by secrecy. Every word I spit out to you not only puts me in danger, but you and that horrible bard over there, by Snake Cult spies. In our line of work, we are fast and stealthy. Those two reasons alone keep us alive. If you reach your enemy before they reach you, then you have already won. Now go away before I think you're a Snake Cultist.
str_scor_response_3|We have and will continue to do so as long as coin exists and problems arise. Supply meets demand. As I was saying, Baltar nearly eliminated most leaders of the tribes, absorbing them as he took them out. It quickly came to be that our order was known to operate as we do now. To avoid dying a pointless death, many leaders chose Baltar as their Khan and he in turn rewarded their loyalty. Our charter allowed us to be hired out in armies as well, to provide morale and support. A scorpion is never fearful, we can strike at a moment's notice and if our blade won't kill you, our poison will. If we find you either on the battlefield or in a dark alley, just know that it's nothing personal, just business.
str_krak_response_3|During the off-season, we become a military force. We mainly provide heavy infantry support to the ranks of armies we fight with. Such is the way of our Fierdsvain blood. We are paired with our equals, the women hunters or The Storm Sisters. These lasses share the the hunt with us. But due to how the charter was formed by Vanskerry Jarls and the charters reliance on such older ways, only men can serve as Krakens. But get in our way and you won't notice a difference in our prowess when it comes to the art of hunting. Either it be bounty or human. We are all flesh and bone to be taken from this world. So ask yourself, are your the hunter or the hunted? Food for thought.

str_feast_lengthy_description_1|The food you provided was insufficient for your guests and their retinues, forcing them to purchase their sustenance from the surrounding countryside at grossly inflated prices. The consensus among those who attended was that you failed to do your duty as a host, diminishing both their trust in you and your overall reputation.
str_feast_lengthy_description_2|The food and drink you provided eventually ran out, forcing some guests to either buy their own from passing peddlars, or send some of their retinue home early. The more charitable attributed the shortfall to poor planning rather than meanness, but either way, it did your reputation no good.
str_feast_lengthy_description_3|The food and drink you provided was adequate for your noble guests, although some of the commoners in their retinues went without. You are establishing a reputation as one who has at least a grasp of your social obligations as a noble.
str_feast_lengthy_description_4|You have provided enough food and drink, and with sufficient varieties, to do yourself credit. The food, drink, and merriment have loosened your guests' tongues, allowing them to converse candidly about the matters of the realm, and deepening their trust in you.
str_feast_lengthy_description_5|You have provided a bountiful table not just for your noble guests but for their retinues, with food left over to be distributed to the poor. Your guests lavish praise upon you for your generosity, and for your understanding of the social obligations of your rank. The conversation, fueled by the food and drink, has been merry, strengthening the bonds between those who attended.
str_feast_lengthy_description_6|The realm will be speaking of the bounty of your table for months to come, and it will become the standard to which all other feasts will aspire. You have filled the bellies not just of your noble guests and their retinues, but also of the poor who flocked to the gates.

str_achieve_cheater_warn_2|You cheated to win that battle! This is your second and final warning - if you continue with your dishonorable behavior, you won't get any achievement rewards until you start a new game.

str_achieve_gm|You have risen through the ranks of a Knighthood Order to become its Grandmaster, a position of considerable power and influence among the elite soldiery of Pendor. Your exalted title wins you +1 Persuasion. You are a force to be reckoned with.
str_buriligi_intro|Guided by me, you will attain Paradise through martyrdom. I will open your mind and expand your conciousness, bring you to the light through my inspiration. Pendor is a teeming morass of sin and I shall not rest until I have purged it of all which opposes the enlightenment given me by the gods. All will face the choice of conversion or instant execution. I like to eat dates and play takhte when the gods are not speaking through me, hee, hee. Do you have a takhte board with you? Let's have a game.
str_buriligi_explain_1|Only through me can you walk the paths of righteousness. Ask any of my followers and they will tell you that, until they came unto me, their lives were empty, sinful and purposeless. I give them a direction, a just cause and the will to fight and die for their beliefs. You will also enjoy the method by which, ahem, I aid such enlightenment.
str_buriligi_explain_2|Do you play takhte? It is a fine strategy game. If you have any dates, I'd like some. Hee, hee, hee, just wait until I rule all Pendor. I will herd these lords and kings like sheep into my fold and slaughter them. 'Better living through chemistry,' hee, hee, that's my motto! Did I ask if you had any dates?
str_oswald_intro|I was outlawed by my own father over a small misunderstanding, and intend to rectify this via conquest. The rumor that I poisoned my elder brother is overblown. A petty little fool like you can scarcely comprehend the methods of one so superior, but I will attempt to educate you. Successful conquest is achieved through ruthlessness and artistic killing. Inspire terror in your enemies prior to engaging them, and the battle is won before the first sword is drawn. The more hideous examples you make, the easier it becomes to cow your enemies into abject surrender. Once I offered surrender but was refused, so I cut off all their heads and stacked them into a pyramid. Lovely sight, that.
str_oswald_explain_1|It is quite simple - grab your enemy by the balls and his heart and mind will follow. Do not release your captives, torture them and leave their mutilated remains for all to admire. Ransoming prisoners or selling them into slavery is so mundane. There are so many more enjoyable and educational ways of dealing with them.
str_oswald_explain_2|I like to rope my prisoners into three lines: children, women and men. First, I kill the children as their mothers shriek and plead for their little lives. Next, I have my men rape the women while the men curse and struggle helplessly, then we slit their throats. The men I torture to death in creative ways. The next time I confront an enemy, I offer a choice between instant surrender or similar treatment. You'd be surprised how often a stronger foe capitulates at the prospect of such a fate. You look a bit queasy - did you eat something which disagrees with you?
str_meregan_intro|I am an easy man to understand. My code is straightforward and my troop and I live by it. When I take a contract to escort a lord's wife or guard a caravan, the caravan arrives intact and on time, and the noble ladies are shown great courtesy and guarded carefully during their journey. Hah, sometimes they are guarded more assiduously than they'd prefer, much to their chagrin, if you take my meaning! We are very discreet, and are given confidential jobs, such as retrieving runaway wives or delivering letters which must not fall into the wrong hands. Never a word leaks out, when I handle the job.
str_meregan_explain_1|I have excellent female fighters in my company, so I detail them as guards for the ladies I escort. They are well-mannered and the ladies enjoy their conversation; in fact, I actually have recruits from amongst the nobility - lord's daughters who wished for the freedom enjoyed by the women of my troop. My lasses can hold their own in a battle or a tavern brawl, as their would-be seducers have found.
str_meregan_explain_2|Do not think our courtesy in any way hampers our efficiency. My troops are ferocious fighters, one and all, and our reputation for relentless defense of our charges and skill in battle precedes us. We are rarely challenged by bandits or other riffraff. When a king hires the Griffonsword Company, he gets a lot more than he pays for!
str_kodan_intro|No doubt you have heard that tavern ditty that begins 'My father arrived on a Vanskerry raid, and married my mother, a Fierdsvain maid...'  It goes on to describe my exploits pretty well. My company includes many former Vanskerry Raiders and their Fierdsvain-born sons. My lads have a few bad habits, such as wrecking the Valonbray tavern once in awhile, but it is all in good fun, and I always pay the tavern keep for the damages. They are a fierce lot and, thanks to my training and discipline, far surpass the Vanskerries and every other Pendor company in fighting skill.
str_kodan_explain_1|My philosophy, like me, is very simple: I honor my word, do exactly what I am hired to do and extract payment by force if my employer tries to weasel out of paying me. Koningur Valdis is a prime example: not long ago, he hired me to kick a little Vanskerry butt along the coast, which I did, but he then tried to re-negotiate the terms of payment for the job.
str_kodan_explain_2|After I raided a few dozen of his caravans, he came around. I even deducted the value of the goods I looted from the balance he owed me, though I doubt he paid the caravan masters for their losses, stingy old bastard that he is. If you want a job done right, my Ironsword Company is the company you hire. When the Ironsword Company goes Pendor on somebody's ass, every lord and king hears about it within a day!
str_syla_intro|Confide in a worthless upstart like you? I think not! The corpses I leave behind on the field of battle will tell you all you need to know about Syla Uzas. If you want to learn more, pit your paltry little troop against mine. You will learn then the folly of bothering your betters.
str_syla_explain_1|You are a glutton for abuse, aren't you? I take what I want by force and no man can stand against me. I kill those annoy me as you would swat a persistent fly. My company has never been defeated.
str_syla_explain_2|I am here solely to negotiate a contract for the elimination of someone who has annoyed someone else. That is all you need to know. Pester me further, and I'll toss you to my men. I'm sure they will find you more entertaining than I do.
str_shalavan_intro|I am a former lord of the D'Shar, unjustly deprived of my holdings by the Bahadur Khan. I have called blood feud upon him, and I shall take not only my lands but also his as well in revenge. His army shall become my army and his women my women. I will wear his crown and feast in his palace when I defeat him. His head will rest upon a platter on my table as I devour his delicacies.
str_shalavan_explain_1|That fornicating camel-lover had the audacity to command me, Shalavan, a true D'Shar, to cease raiding and send my men to aid his endless wars. I informed him that he could damned well recruit the men he needed elsewhere, as I was occupied with the traditional D'Shar ways of making a living. In revenge, he sent his men to drive me from my land and stripped me of my titles.
str_shalavan_explain_2|He already feels my vengeance. Since he named me outlaw, outlaw I have become and my forces swell with recruited raiders from the fearsome Pansjiri, Turkmani and Balochi raiders throughout the Principalities. At the hands of outlaws shall he fall! I intend to raze the D'Shar cities, execute his soft and lazy lords and restore the D'Shar to the nomadic tribal state traditional to our people. Let Kadan sip wine, recite poetry and amuse himself with his women while he yet can. His days as Bahadur Khan are numbered!
str_boris_intro|Doubtless you would, as most little mercenaries aspire to be just like me! That is a vain aspiration, but I am bored, so I will condescend to chat for a moment. My Ravens excel in siegework and are the most fearsome fighters in Pendor. I deign to work for petty Pendor rulers on occasion, but only for a very high price. Never think I don't get my price, too - they soil their armor at the thought of what I would do if they tried to double cross me. They are feckless fools and one day, I will take their thrones.
str_boris_explain_1|Pendor needs a strong and intelligent ruler, one who can unite the land under one banner. I know in my heart that I am the hero Madigan prophecied would succeed at that. Of course, I don't share that information with the kings who engage my services. Hah, even if I did, those morons would ignore the warning! I'd suggest that, should you happen upon us in the field, you beat a very hasty retreat. You'll live longer if you do.
str_boris_explain_2|We are not only superb at siegework, for I am a most excellent strategist. The Ravenstern lords run like frightened virgins when they encounter us. I milk those lords for every denar they have in ransom, too. One lord, whom I won't name, even offered me the use of his wife and daughters if I'd just let him go. Hmph, a man like me does not need to pay for noble bedmates! I get more offers of that sort than I want or need! Perhaps, if you continue to increase in skill, I may hire your company when I rule Pendor. Now run along; you bore me.
str_inquisitor_intro|The holy men with me will help rid these lands of vile worshipers of Erida Occisor! Death to all demon spawn and their heathen followers! Those sand-faring people of the south need to stop believing in such false idols like that of Vata or Indar!
str_inquisitor_explain_1|No, I have said enough!
str_inquisitor_explain_2|Bother me more and we will continue this conversation in Inquisition's dungeons.
str_heartbeat_intro_1|{reg63?M'lord:M'lady}! I am glad you arrived so quickly.
str_heartbeat_intro_2|{reg63?M'lord:M'lady}, thank you for making all haste.
str_heartbeat_intro_3|{reg63?M'lord:M'lady}! We need your help in a matter of importance.
str_heartbeat_intro_4|{reg63?M'lord:M'lady}, I am so glad that you are here!

str_heartbeat_intro_6|I am so glad you have arrived, {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}! We need your help.
str_heartbeat_intro_7|Ah! {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}, thank the Gods that you have come!
str_heartbeat_intro_response_1|Well, I am here, so tell me what is the matter?
str_heartbeat_intro_response_2|Well? What is so important?
str_heartbeat_intro_response_3|Yes, we came as soon as possible.
str_heartbeat_intro_response_4|Go on, what is so urgent?
str_heartbeat_intro_response_5|We rode through the night to get here, what has happened?
str_heartbeat_intro_response_6|We came in great haste. Speak up, what's the problem?
str_heartbeat_intro_response_7|Ah yes! What is the issue?
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_1|Rats, {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}! We have a terrible infestation of rats.
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_2|We have had unusually heavy rains and some flooding {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}.
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_3|We need to hire the local Witch, {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}!
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_4|Two of the village clans are fighting again - they've sworn blood feud against one another.
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_5|We have a situation with horse thieves here, {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}!
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_6|Wolves! We are besieged by an enormous pack of ravening wolves!
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_7|{reg63?M'lord:M'lady}, we have a refugee problem.
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_8|We have had a fire {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}!
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_9|Our wells are befouled and may have been poisoned!
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_10|We've captured a Heretic!
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_11|The Snake Cult is spying on us!
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_12|It is about the shrine, {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}.
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_13|We are stricken with disease.
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_14|{reg63?M'lord:M'lady}, there is a mercenary company here requesting to speak with you.
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_15|There are thieves among us! They're robbing everybody!
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_16|It concerns the castle {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}! Repairs are urgently needed.
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_17|Deserters, dangerous ones, {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}!
str_heartbeat_problem_statement_18|We need to review some petitions for new trade routes.
str_heartbeat_problem_1_a|They are as big as small dogs and have carried off children! Our villagers are afraid to take to the fields and some refuse to leave their home. Can you help us?
str_heartbeat_problem_1_b|They are everywhere, even in the cooking pots and under the beds. They scurry everywhere, destroying our food stocks and spreading their filth! If we don't do something, they may cause a plague. We need your help!
str_heartbeat_problem_1_c|They are huge {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}! They scurry everywhere, destroying our food stocks and spreading their filth! If we don't do something, they may cause a plague. They have glittering eyes, small jutting teeth... <shudder>, we are only poor farmers and need your help to rid ourselves of these filthy rodents!
str_heartbeat_problem_1_d|Some are very large and they are very aggressive. Packs of them have attacked our villagers in the fields and many people are afraid to venture out of their homes to tend the crops. Can you help us?
str_heartbeat_problem_2_a|The streams have overflowed from these torrential rains, and have washed away the roads.
str_heartbeat_problem_2_b|The fields have flooded and we may lose our crops! Some farmers have been ruined already.
str_heartbeat_problem_2_c|The sudden flooding has washed away some farms and several people have drowned!
str_heartbeat_problem_2_d|Due to recent heavy rains, the river is rising and the village crops are threatened by flood. If we don't do something, our crops will be destroyed.
str_heartbeat_problem_3_a|Some disease is destroying our crops; they are wilting and rotting.  We must hire the local Witch to remove the curse from our harvest. Will you help us?
str_heartbeat_problem_3_b|We have not had rain in a long time, and our crops are failing. We need to hire the local druidic witch to invoke the rain to save our crops!  We need your help!
str_heartbeat_problem_3_c|The local Witch says that we have been cursed! Two women here have had miscarriages, a horse died unexpectedly and five villagers have had freakish accidents. We need to hire the Witch to remove this curse!
str_heartbeat_problem_3_d|Many of our villagers have come down with a strange fever. A local Witch says she can help us, but she will not do it for free. Can you help us?
str_heartbeat_problem_4_a|The old clan led by one of the Village Elders has killed four people of the newcomer clan. The newcomers have killed six of the old clan thus far. This started over a perceived slight to the Village Elder who then raided a newcomer farm and burned their barn to the ground. This feud could go on for generations, if it is not stopped now by someone in authority whom the tribes respect. 
str_heartbeat_problem_4_b|The tribal elder claims a man of the of the newcomer clan dishonored his daughter. The elder claim their man offered honorable marriage to the girl, when she discovered she was bearing his child, but her father demanded a ridiculous dowry. When the newcomer clan refused to pay it, the Village Elder declared blood feud.
str_heartbeat_problem_4_c|We've a disagreement over a stolen blue-eyed sheep escalating into a clan feud. The Tribal Elder purchased the sheep from the newcomers, who apparently did not receive payment. They took back the sheep, citing nonpayment and perverse use of livestock, and took a dozen of the Elders sheep as interest. The Elder has sworn blood feud and the situation grows worse by the hour.
str_heartbeat_problem_4_d|Recently a large new family moved into the area and set up several farms. They need water from a small stream to water their fields, a stream that flows upstream through a village Elder's farm. The Elder built a dam and asks payment from the new family to let the water through. This has erupted into a feud which might turn very ugly. We need your help.
str_heartbeat_problem_5_a|One of our citizens claims his plow horses have been stolen. He's looked everywhere and cannot locate them, so we doubt it simply wandered off. Can you help us?
str_heartbeat_problem_5_b|One of the peasants claims there are bandits in the area and they stole their horses. We need your help to recover them.
str_heartbeat_problem_5_c|We have a report that several bandits made off with a herd of our horses. {M'lord/M'lady}, we need your help in recovering them.
str_heartbeat_problem_5_d|A known thief and his sidekick stole two of our horses. Will you help track them down and recover our horses?
str_heartbeat_problem_6_a|A pack of wolves has come down from the mountains and is ravaging the villagers' livestock. One herder was attacked and fear is running high.
str_heartbeat_problem_6_b|Some of the peasants think the Mystmountain Raiders are stealing their herds, but the carcasses devoured are left behind.
str_heartbeat_problem_6_c|The villagers say the wolves are very fierce and bold and they are too afraid to guard their herds at night. 
str_heartbeat_problem_6_d|We must eliminate these wolves before the villagers' herds are all eaten!
str_heartbeat_problem_7_a|A large band of refugees is harassing the locals. They first asked for food, and were given some, but now they refuse to leave! What do you want to do with them?
str_heartbeat_problem_7_b|A group of refugees is squatting just outside of the marketplace. They have taken to begging and harassing people who enter the market. This, of course, is nuisance to the merchants, who want them removed. What do you want to do?
str_heartbeat_problem_7_c|We've a pack of peasant refugees outside the gate, petitioning you for aid.
str_heartbeat_problem_7_d|We have a large group of refugees, including several families with small children, who want to start a new life here. What do we tell them?
str_heartbeat_problem_8_a|The forest outside the village caught fire, it spread and the village mill was severely damaged.
str_heartbeat_problem_8_b|There was a fire in the smithy which spread to the market, and damaged it badly.
str_heartbeat_problem_8_c|The was a fire that started in the stables and spread through the area. 
str_heartbeat_problem_8_d|We have had a succession of suspicious fires that have damaged homes and businesses 
str_heartbeat_problem_9_a|Someone has thrown the rotting carcass of a goat into the well, and the water is completely befouled.
str_heartbeat_problem_9_b|There is an outbreak of typhoid here, and we fear polluted wells are the cause.
str_heartbeat_problem_9_c|Five men died this morning after drinking from the well. I fear an enemy has poisoned it.
str_heartbeat_problem_9_d|A troublemaker we made outcast was seen pouring something into the well, and now the water is foul tasting and makes us sick.
str_heartbeat_problem_10_a|The peasants claim a woman in the village is a Heretic and want to burn her at the stake. She's ancient and reputed to be very nasty, so I'm not sure if she is a Heretic or just a senile, disagreeable old bag whom the villagers dislike.
str_heartbeat_problem_10_b|We found the body of a girl with her heart ripped out. We've captured one of the five Heretics who murdered her. When taken, all he did was yell 'For Glory'! He shows no fear at all.
str_heartbeat_problem_10_c|We've caught an unsavory character lurking around the marketplace. From the look and smell of him, he is a Heretic! We're holding him for your judgement.
str_heartbeat_problem_10_d|We have caught an odd wandering old man who is wild eyed and babbles about a plot to take you as a sacrifice to Erida Occisor. What shall we do with him?
str_heartbeat_problem_11_a|A Snake Cult Armsman bought some vegetables from us, and asked whether we had any girl babies here.
str_heartbeat_problem_11_b|A woman who hissed when she spoke questioned the tavern keeper about how many troops we have stationed here. He spotted her walking around later,too, looking all about.
str_heartbeat_problem_11_c|A couple of men showed up here asking for work, and we think they may be Snake Cult spies. They didn't do much work at all, just hung about and looked over the battlements and other defenses.
str_heartbeat_problem_11_d|Rumor holds that six orphan girls are missing. We think the Snake Cult is taking them.
str_heartbeat_problem_12_a|To pray for better crops, we'd like to build a shrine to Thallo Ver Shures, but we can't afford the cost. Will you help us?
str_heartbeat_problem_12_b|The Snake Cult defiled the shrine of Damia Provideo and we must build a new one before the Harvest Festival. Will you help us?
str_heartbeat_problem_12_c|We think that if we had a shrine to Eunomia Stabilitis here, some of the lawlessness in the surrounding country would abate. Could you pay for the shrine?
str_heartbeat_problem_12_d|The Knights of Dawn demand we erect a shrine to Astraea here, and say we have to tear down all our other shrines to the Pendor gods. What should we do?
str_heartbeat_problem_13_a|The people have broken out in itchy red spots all over their bodies, and fear it is the Red Plague. Rumor holds that a band of Snake Cultists crossed the fields last week. They may have sent the plague.
str_heartbeat_problem_13_b|The men ate some bad food, and they are all in agony with stomach trouble. The jakes are in a terrible state, just terrible, and the whole area is covered in vomit! What should we do?
str_heartbeat_problem_13_c|Half the garrison is afflicted with, ahem, a social disease, {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}, and the source is almost certainly the local brothel.
str_heartbeat_problem_13_d|There is something in the air that makes us sneeze and cough all the time. The people think it must be some kind of plague.
str_heartbeat_problem_14_a|The {s20} leading a company of {s21} has approached us asking for employment. They look like a well-trained force. They will join you for 10,000 denars.
str_heartbeat_problem_14_b|{reg63?M'lord:M'lady}, a company of {s21} arrived a few days ago. They are seeking employment and await your decision on hiring them. Their leader, a {s20} requested 10,000 denars to serve you.
str_heartbeat_problem_14_c|{reg63?M'lord:M'lady}, there is a troop of {s21} camped outside our gates. Their leader, a {s20} asks if you will hire them for the sum of 10,000 denars.
str_heartbeat_problem_14_d|There is a large company of {s21} sitting outside our gates! They will hire out for the sum of 10,000 denars. They look fierce and I don't know what they will do if you turn them down!
str_heartbeat_problem_15_a|Someone here is pilfering food. Our stores are going missing regularly.
str_heartbeat_problem_15_b|Someone has raided our weapons stores and taken all our best bows and arrows.
str_heartbeat_problem_15_c|Someone here is picking pockets whenever a crowd assembles. The people are very angry about it.
str_heartbeat_problem_15_d|Someone is stealing our young women's underwear off their drying lines.
str_heartbeat_problem_16_a|During the last siege, the curtain wall was badly damaged and if we don't repair it, it will collapse. It will cost 2500 denars.
str_heartbeat_problem_16_b|One of the castle gates is about to fall off its hinges. We have a serious security problem there.
str_heartbeat_problem_16_c|We've discovered a tunnel in the dungeon leading out to the woods. Should we block it off, {reg63?M'lord:M'lady}, or keep it for emergencies?
str_heartbeat_problem_16_d|There are weak spots in the portcullis and if we have to lower it fast, it may break.
str_heartbeat_problem_17_a|There's a pack of deserters roaming the countryside. The people are terrified of them.
str_heartbeat_problem_17_b|We saw a couple of our men sneaking away last night. They deserted on duty in the middle of the night.
str_heartbeat_problem_17_c|A large band of deserters is raiding caravans and robbing the peasants here.
str_heartbeat_problem_17_d|Some deserters raided the village last week, and they returned again last night!
str_heartbeat_problem_18_a|An Emissary requests your permission to open trade between Duke Sandoval of Barclay and your town.
str_heartbeat_problem_18_b|We have a request from Southern Barclay that we permit their caravans to trade in our town. What do you wish to tell them?
str_heartbeat_problem_18_c|A most importunate group of merchants from Mettenheim wishes to see you for the purpose of trade. They say they can increase prosperity if you agree.
str_heartbeat_problem_18_d|Here is a petition from a trade ambassador that you allow a group of their nobles to open up new sea trade routes from Veccavi to this city.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_1_a|Let's hunt them down. I declare an Open Season on Rats: 1 denar per rat killed!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_1_b|Here are 100 denars. Put out poisoned food for the rats and burn their bodies.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_1_c|Call in that fellow, Hamlin, the best of the Pendor Rat-Catchers. Here are 500 denars to pay him.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_1_d|Do I look like a rat-catcher, fool? Solve this rat problem yourself.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_2_a|What do you suppose I can do about normal weather? Live with it!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_2_b|I am sorry to hear that. Distribute these 100 denars to those who need it.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_2_c|Here are 1000 denars to aid those in need.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_2_d|Take 2500 denars for repairs and for those who need help.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_3_a|What? We do not believe in superstitious rubbish!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_3_b|Take 100 denars and find a solution which does not include a Witch.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_3_c|Here are 500 denars to hire your Witch.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_3_d|Take 1000 denars, hire the Witch and have her bless our village as well!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_4_a|This is your problem to solve, not mine.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_4_b|Order the local militia to enforce the peace!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_4_c|Here are 300 denars. Give this to the village Elder as payment to end the Blood Feud.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_4_d|Take 500 denars for the widows, arrest the leaders of both clans and hang them!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_5_a|Tell them to mend their fences and watch the horses more carefully in future.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_5_b|Here are 200 denars as a bounty for the return of the horses.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_5_c|Take these 300 denars and buy them more horses.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_5_d|Order the Militia and hunt down those thieves!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_6_a|You have plenty of hunters here; send them out to kill the wolves!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_6_b|Take 100 denars, hire some extra hunters and eliminate the pack!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_6_c|Take 400 denars, ask advice of the local Witch and follow it.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_6_d|Here are 100 denars for bait, now take the militia and trap the beasts!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_7_a|We have no need of more mouths to feed; run them off.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_7_b|Give them some food, then send them on their way.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_7_c|They are welcome to stay. It is our duty to show charity to those in need.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_7_d|We could use more subjects. Here are 800 denars to build them houses.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_8_a|I'll give 500 denars towards materials for repairs, but you will have to provide the labor.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_8_b|Take these 1000 denars and begin repairs immediately.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_8_c|You dragged me back here urgently for a fire?! You try my patience severely.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_8_d|Arrest whoever started the fire and hang him.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_9_a|So drain and clean the well, fool. Here are 100 denars for the labor.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_9_b|We'd best summon  physicians to deal with any sickness. Here are 500 denars.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_9_c|Find the one who befouled or poisoned the well. Under torture, discover who sent him.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_9_d|Have the militia hunt down the culprit and hang him.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_10_a|We hand over all Heretics to the Knights of Dawn. See to it.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_10_b|Inform the captured Heretic that we will torture the confession out of them 'for Glory'!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_10_c|Let us be quite sure we are actually dealing with Heretics before we kill an innocent.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_10_d|I have dealt with heretics before and killed plenty. This is not one of them. Let this person go.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_11_a|If anyone told him we've girl babies here, flog the blabbermouth for his indiscretion!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_11_b|Have the guard track down and capture the spy. Offer a reward of 500 denars for a live one!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_11_c|Flog the captain of the guard for letting Snake Cultists in here to begin with!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_11_d|Here are 2000 denars. Get any orphans off the street and housed safely in an orphanage.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_12_a|I'm not paying to support superstitious nonsense like shrines to gods who don't exist!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_12_b|Certainly. Here are 350 denars for your shrine.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_12_c|Here, take 200 denars, build your shrine over in the next kingdom. Not here.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_12_d|Very well build your shrine, just do not cause strife in my realm with followers of other Deities.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_13_a|Here are 500 denars. Send for physicians from the Radiant Cross.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_13_b|Take these 300 denars and find whatever medicines you need.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_13_c|Cease your sinful habits and the gods won't send you diseases in punishment.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_13_d|Do I look like a physician? I can't do anything about this!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_14_a|I cannot afford to pay that sum just now. Send them on their way.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_14_b|Excellent news! I can certainly use them. Here are 10,000 denars.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_14_c|I don't trust mercenaries. Tell them to leave immediately.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_14_d|Hmm, Yes indeed. Give them an extra 2000 denars for goodwill and have them report forthwith!
str_heartbeat_problem_response_15_a|Hmm, if the thief stole from true need, find out why and give him aid.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_15_b|Security here needs an overhaul. Post additional patrols to keep this from happening again.
str_heartbeat_problem_response_15_c|Take the Militia and do a house to house search!

str_quick_battle_troop_1|There is a reason no one goes about the cities without armed guards once the sun sets, and that reason is Rodrigo de Braganca. Once a bright eyed merchant who arrived at Valonbray with a small fortune in rubies and a dream to corner the velvet market, he was soon reduced to a pauper, having lost everything to cutthroat competition with the colluding Empire merchant guilds. But he soon turned measuring scales into swords, and applied his considerable business smarts into building up the deadliest criminal enterprise in Ethos, with hideouts and operations in every major town. He has attained his goal, for the price on his head is greater than the riches he once pursued. Now he takes great pleasure in relieving his former competitors of their worldly goods - and worries.
str_quick_battle_troop_2|Usiatra usurped leadership of the group of bandits that occupied Siri, a rural village in the southern deserts outside the realm of Pendor, in a curt and bloody fashion when she was seventeen years old. Under her direction, the band of ruffians quickly expanded their operations across the southlands. Her shrewd, decisive manner, combined with her merciless ambition which she acts upon with inhuman composure and cruelty, garners fanatic admiration from those that follow her. As such, amongst her own she lives a decadent, spoilt lifestyle -- built upon the violent plundering she exacts in her travels. Her military strength and natural strategic wit allowed her outfit to remain undealt with in her homeland, and now she turns her eye towards the rich lands of Pendor to sustain her war band.
str_quick_battle_troop_3|The second son of a minor noble living near Marleons, Hegen was educated in the art of war and single combat. After being knighted he served as a paid knight in the army of the lord of Marleons and fought against the Ravenstern before leading a group of outriders that defeated a D'Shar raid near Amere. The ensuing counter raid and the following two campaigns earned him glory and fame as a warrior. Unfortunately, he lost any chance of further prestige when peace was declared and he was discharged. With no hope of inheriting and his skills at war languishing in peace, he assembled other young warriors and set out as a mercenary captain. He now hopes to take advantage of the fact that Pendor never lacks warring states in need of mercenaries.
str_quick_battle_troop_4|Konrad is a professional mercenary from the distant land of Balion, far beyond the vast western ocean. Having spent most of his years on campaign and seen countless battles, Konrad has grown to love his life as a soldier of fortune. Though he once had his nose flattened by a mace blow and has received many wounds, he has nevertheless survived this harsh existence through the strength of his arm, innate cunning and pure luck. Hearing of the lucrative career opportunities awaiting a man of his talents in Pendor, Konrad chartered a vessel and crossed the sea with his men in search of new wars to fight in. A sellsword with no ties to any of the Pendorian states, he is more than happy to offer his services to any lord with a fat enough coin-purse.
str_quick_battle_troop_5|Sverre is one of the so-called sea raiders -- freebooters and lawless men from the icy realm of Jumne beyond the North Sea, also said to be the ancestral home of the Nords. Already as a young man he has been along on many raids against both his distant cousins in the Windholm region and the Ravenstern. However, Sverre was always a sharp lad, and it didn't take him long to see that Pendor was a far more prosperous land than his own, and that he could have a better life here than among his own people. During a raid on Jayek, Sverre stole away while his comrades were busy looting the village and taking captives. Passing himself off as a yokel from the Chalbek mountains, Sverre quickly built up a reputation for himself as a fierce fighter, and he now seeks his fortune at the head of a mercenary band.
str_quick_battle_troop_6|Hailing from Charnye, in the far reaches of the Ravenstern tundra, Borislav is a hunter. For all of his life he has tracked the beasts of the wild for their meat and fur, living off the land just as his forefathers had done in happier days, before the endless wars. Now, the game is quick to take fright from the constant sounds of battle, and the wanton slaughter of animals by soldiers has left empty those forests that have not been burnt down. Facing starvation, Borislav chose to turn his great skill with bow and spear, learned from hunting stag, wolf, and bear, to the practice of hunting men, and his steady hand and keen eye have claimed many lives. Borislav does not care much for the disputes of kingdoms, and is only really interested in keeping himself and his men fed.
str_quick_battle_troop_7|Stavros was born in the independent city-state of Zendar, and spent much of his adult life serving in the town watch under the famous constable Hareck. Stavros' leadership and prowess were instrumental in ridding the area of the dreaded river pirates, but even he was powerless against the calamity that befell the city. When Zendar was razed to the ground by a great horde of sea raiders, Stavros fled the burning city in a crowd of refugees. After a brief period of wandering and odd jobs, he found a place in a mercenary company, eventually rising to become its leader due to his dedication and tactical aptitude. He now devotes most of his efforts to working with manhunters and local authorities against the sea raiders and other outlaws, trying to keep the land safe for travelers.
str_quick_battle_troop_8|Growing up with one of the nomadic tribes deep in the desert beyond D'Shar lands, Gamara learned early on how to hunt with sling and spear. However, the simple life and pitiless conditions in the desert did not satisfy her, and she burned with a desire to see the great world beyond that she had heard so many wondrous tales about. Life is not easy for an adventuring young woman, and Gamara had to learn the ways of Pendor quickly. Taking the weapons and armor of a soldier who had attacked her after a dispute, Gamara now hides her beauty under thick Sarranid garb, and many never even suspect she is a woman - certainly as a force on the battlefield she is as dangerous as any man. She has gathered about her a group of followers, and together they wander the war-torn land in search of glory.
str_quick_battle_troop_9|Aethrod is not a noble person. He's changed his name twice, and is blamed for most of the crimes on Ravenstern territory. True or not, he claims to never have taken an innocent man's life, and considers himself a patriotic citizen, several times bringing his band or renegades to the assistance of his faction, when it is threatened. In times of peace, however, most lords must be careful when he is in the vicinity due to his daring personality and willingness to challenge a lord. Born and raised in the slums of Ravenstern, he learned how to use a bow at an early age and ran away from home a fourteen. Now at thirty two, his archery skills are near perfect and though he can't ride a horse well, he can hit one at the furthest of distances. Tough as nails and sharp as a hawk, he is a true local legend.
str_quick_battle_troop_10|Being the daughter of one of the most infamous bandit leaders in the D'Shar realm isn't always easy, but Zaira seems to have managed quite well. Unlike most women she grew up learning the ways of the desert warrior and is deadly with the sword as well as the bow. While the other girls her age learned how to manage the household, Zaira learned how to best gut a merchant before taking his money. At the age of sixteen Zaira had killed more men than the average veteran in the Khan's army. Just before her twentieth birthday her father was killed in brawl with another bandit leader. As the only child, Zaira now took control of her father's band. After avenging her father, she quickly picked up where he had left. Now she's on a good way of establishing her own reputation has a bandit leader.
str_quick_battle_troop_11|Argo Sendnar had quite a diversified life. When he arrived at Pendor, working as a trader, he hoped for more income than in Lokti. Little did he know, that the wartorn Pendor was a wasps' nest for bandits and cutthroats that made trading a lot more complicated than in Lokti. Being bought out by another competeting trader, after losing all his goods and money due to caravan raids, he was forced to serve as a caravan guard to make a living. Despite his pathetic fighting skills, he soon found an employment on one of the more dangerous routes through Pendor. Due to sheer luck he managed to stay alive long enough to acquire enough combat experience and money to start his own business as a caravan master, offering his services to traders in need of defense for their goods.

str_you_fought_normal_at_town_fight_survived|Well done! I hear you accounted for one or two of the bastards, and you're still on your feet. You can't ask for a better outcome of a battle than that...
str_you_fought_bad_at_town_fight_survived|Well, the enemy is in flight, and it looks like you're still on your feet. At the end of the day, that's all that's important in a battle.
str_you_fought_well_at_town_fight|Ah! You're awake. You took quite a blow, there. But good news! We defeated them -- and you did them some real damage before you went down. If you hadn't been here, it could have gone very baldy. I'm grateful to you...
str_you_wounded_at_town_fight|Ah! You're alive. That's a relief. You took quite a blow, there. I'm not sure that you got any of them yourself, but thankfully, the rest of us were able to beat them. We'll need to see about getting you some treatment... 
str_you_fought_well_at_town_fight_survived_answer|Let every villain learn to fear the name {playername}!
str_you_fought_normal_at_town_fight_survived_answer|Ah, well, I'm proud to have done my bit along with the rest...
str_you_fought_bad_at_town_fight_survived_answer|Well, I was about to strike one down, but I slipped in some blood, you see...
str_you_fought_well_at_town_fight_answer|Ah well. I guess I don't mind a blow taken in a good cause.
str_you_wounded_at_town_fight_answer|Right. I suppose I should be more careful.
str_unfortunately_reg0_civilians_wounded_during_fight_more| Unfortunately, about {reg0} of my lads got themselves wounded. I should go look on on them.
str_unfortunately_reg0_civilians_wounded_during_fight| Unfortunately, one of my lads took a pretty nasty blow. I should go see how he is doing.
str_also_one_another_good_news_is_any_civilians_did_not_wounded_during_fight| Also, no one on our side was hurt very seriously. That's good news
str_merchant_and_you_call_some_townsmen_and_guards_to_get_ready_and_you_get_out_from_tavern|You leave the tavern and go out to the streets. Nervous looking young men are waiting in every street corner. You can see they have daggers and clubs concealed under their clothes, and catch a mixture of fear, anticipation and pride in the quick looks they throw at you as you pass by. Praying that your enemies have not been alarmed by this all too obvious bunch of plotters, you check your weapons for one last time and prepare yourself for the action ahead.
str_town_fight_ended_you_and_citizens_cleaned_town_from_bandits|The remaining few bandits scatter off to the town's narrow alleys, only to be hunted down one by one by the angry townsfolk. Making sure that your victory is complete and all the wounded have been taken care of, you and the merchant head to his house to review the day's events.
str_town_fight_ended_you_and_citizens_cleaned_town_from_bandits_you_wounded|You fall down with that last blow, unable to move and trying hard not to pass out. Soon the sounds of fighting filling the street gives way to the cheers of the townsmen and you realize with relief that your side won the day. Soon, friendly arms pick you up from the ground and you let yourself drift off to a blissful sleep. Hours later, you wake up in the merchants house.
str_journey_to_sarleon|You travel by caravan through the heartland of Pendor. Green shoots of wheat are beginning to push through the dark soil of Sarleon's rolling plains. The land here is rich, but troubled, as the occasional burning village bears witness. The caravan avoids the Woods of Laria, where desperate men have taken refuge and the mysterious Noldor lurk. You crest a ridge and catch sight of the town of Sarleon, its rooftops shining golden in the last rays of the setting sun.
str_journey_to_ravenstern|You travel through the Ravenstern highlands, exposed to bitter winds and snow, with a backdrop of howling wolves. Much of the land here is frozen solid for part of the year, but Ravenstern's forests are rich with fur-bearing game, and the river teems with fish. Miners wrest iron from the unyielding mountains. The riches of the land draw traders, but the traders, in turn, draw bandits. Mystmountain Raiders, mounted on shaggy horses, watch the passage of your caravan from a snowy ridge but luckily don't attack. You are glad when the spires of the town of Ravenstern come into view.
str_journey_to_torbah|You came with a caravan carrying goods from faraway lands to trade for salt and D'Shar spices. It was hard going. At last you crested a ridge before you appeared on the D'Shar plains. Thin spring grass was already turning yellow in the sandy landscape, punctuated only by distant D'Shar Raiders and what the Caravan Master said were bands of dissident Knights and Singalian Slavers. Herds of steppe ponies guarded by tribal clans testified to the wealth of the D'Shar Khans. Small groups of horsemen followed your caravan from a distance, but your caravan was well-guarded and they did not attack. Still, you were relieved to arrive at last in the low, mud-walled town of Torbah unscathed.
str_journey_to_javiksholm|You took passage on a Barclay merchant ship, heavily loaded with trade goods to be sold to wealthy Fierdsvain merchants, and distributed by caravans throughout Pendor. It was not a favorable season for sailing; the ship struggled through storms and heavy seas. Twice your captain outsailed marauding Vanskerry Raider longships bound from their frozen lairs to ravage the Fierdsvain coasts. The captain explained that the Fierdsvain was home to the Vanskerries' distant kinsmen, the Fierdsvain lords, who only a few generations before had carved themselves a kingdom in this rich but troubled land.
str_journey_to_janos|You arrived by ship, skirting the sands where the Empire lands meet the sea. Much of the coastline was obscured by tendrils of fog which obscured its flatlands and forests. Occasionally you caught sight of a village watchtower rising above the mists -- and on one occasion, a beacon fire burning to warn of a Snake Cult warband. The captain told you tales of this infamous cult which regularly invaded the Empire, seeking to turn the Empire to worship of its hideous goddess. You were relieved when your ship docked in Janos, and marvelled at the sight of Empire galleys riding at anchor, pennants fluttering in the evening breeze.

str_lost_tavern_duel_ordinary|You slump to the floor, stunned by the drunk's last blow. Your attacker's rage immediately seems to slacken. He drops into a chair and sits there watching you, muttering under his breath, almost regretfully. A few of the other patrons manage to coax him to his feet and bundle him out the door. One of the others attends to your wounds, and soon you too are back on your feet, unsteady but alive.
str_lost_tavern_duel_assassin|You slump to the floor, stunned by your attacker's last blow. Slowly and deliberately, he kneels down by your side, pulling a long knife from under his clothes. But before he can finish you off, the tavernkeeper, who seems to have regained his courage, comes up from behind and gives your attacker a clout behind the head. He loses his balance, and then, seeing that his chance to kill you has been lost, makes a dash for the door. He gets away. Meanwhile, the other tavern patrons bind your wounds and haul you to a back room to rest and recover.
str_lost_startup_hideout_attack|You recover consciousness a short while later, and see that the kidnappers have celebrated their victory by breaking open a cask of wine, and have forgotten to take a few elementary precautions -- like binding your hands and feet. You manage to slip away. Based on the boisterous sounds coming from the hideout, you suspect that you may yet have some time to gather a few more followers and launch another attack.

str_bookseller_3_rumor_1|Hmm, something did happen the other day. I've met a fellow, an acquaintance of mine, who serves as a Marinus. You know, the sergeants from the Order of the Shadow Legion? See, he told me something that I still wonder about. Their name, 'Marinus', means 'fleet infantry', but they fight on the land with the Legion. Also their weapon of choice, the halberd. It isn't often used on ships, so why would that be their weapon of choice? There are plenty of better situational weaponry to use when at sea. Anyway, that's all there is to be said on that.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_2|One summer night I spent some time in Cez and ended up hearing some discussion between two Shadow Legion Centurions on patrol. They were talking about something called Iron Bread Scallops. I never heard of such a delicacy before and I didn't have much time to go and find the shop that offers them. I will have to visit when I go to Cez next time. Hopefully they won't cost over 10,000 denars! Haha!
str_bookseller_3_rumor_3|When my travels took me to the snowy ranges of Ravenstern, I came across some very interesting rumors of the famous Dragon order. As the rumor goes, it is stated that all nobles who train to be a Dragon undergo incredibly painful tests that involve the snow and cold. Apparently, one of the rituals is to be tossed from the walls into a snowy bank, whilst nude! Don't know what that would accomplish, but to be a Dragon means that you have to be able to fly, right? Except these men aren't spreading wings ...
str_bookseller_3_rumor_4|In my time of exploring. I got to see some fascinating things with the Order of the Dragon. It turns out, that the sergeants, the Dragon Drakes, have to be trained incredibly difficult. Regardless, the last challenge is to spar against two Dragon Knights in hand to hand combat. If you somehow win or are able to stand by the end of the scuffle, you are inducted into the order. You are even given a shield that the knights use themselves. I guess the chain is only as strong as its links.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_5|You've heard of the Order of the Dragon, yes? To be even considered into training, you must be a 2nd generation noble with ties to Ravenstern nobility. Well, a drunkard from a local Ravenstern tavern told me about a recent candidate that got picked to train as a Dragon. The catch is, his family produces and trades with wool clothes, they're merchants! A commoner! Can you believe that? It seems that a man can even purchase nobility these days. We need to make nobility great again.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_6|I've got a juicy piece for you, right from Velar Kerso, a noble Knight of the Clarion Call. While I've looked at him into his magnificent armor, riding his fast warhorse, I really believed that he is better or at least an equal to half of the famous warriors from Noldor. Have you seen their exquisite Hawkstorm bow? And what fine arrows they have! He even permits me to touch one! Aye, there are truly no better horse archers in whole Pendor! No doubt an army of their fine Order can crush everyone under their hooves. Noldor? Who care about the pointy-ear cowards anyway? They can't stand against such skilled and well-trained knights from Sarleon!
str_bookseller_3_rumor_7|I have heard the story of Ordis from Mobray, a Squire of the Lions, who fought against lord Hraven the Bold's warband near the village of Azgad. While the Knights of the Lion flanked the Fierdsvain horde, Ordis and his fellow infantrymen hold the brutal charge of Hraven's huscarls. Being clad in heavy plate armors, wearing the tough steel shield of the Order and armed with morningstars, the Squires suffered heavy casualties still, for the Fierdsvain brutes are chosen for their size and strength as much for their unmatched skills with the axe. Yet Ordis and his comrades managed to hold the line until their reinforcements arrived and repelled the wicked attack. The brave Knights have equally brave sons, there is no doubts in that!
str_bookseller_3_rumor_8|Once I have met a Larian Sentinel and I saw why the Rangers of the Clarion Call employ them on service. Put against an enemy as Noldor, fine archers with inhuman strength and skills, the Order retaliate with force. They hire experienced hunters as their sergeants, giving them expensive and powerful long composite bows and even gave them two quivers of arrows. Nobody else tried to do it, ensuring them a unique advantage. Now they are able to shoot twice as long as any other archer. And with long awlpikes for close combat they support the cavalry force of the Order really well. On the field or during the siege, the humble sergeants became a force to be reckoned with, capable to meet any adversary at any distance.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_9|I have met a very sad Knight of Eventide two days ago. He slowly came by the road against my caravan with sorrow face over his strange looking new armor, riding a black-caparisoned horse almost as sorrow as himself. Although I normally don't approach them, he look so miserably that I stopped and asked him if I could help him with something. He turned his tortured face toward me and said: I joined the Eventide to fight the Dawn mindless torturers. I fought faithfully and survived through the ridiculous requirements for joining the Order, the weak horses they provided, the cheap sword they gave me and the misshapen attributes and skills they expected from their members. But now  He pointed toward his new armor while tears began to streaks down his face. Look at me! I don't even look as Knight of Eventide anymore! The Gods forsake my Order! I will not desert it, but I pray the Goddess to send me death into the next battle! I cannot suffer anymore! Then he bowed his head again and passed the road.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_10|I have met a group of Singalian Horsemen on the road yesterday. When I saw them riding against me with cheerfully grins on their faces I decided that I'll finish on the slave market but they only asked me if I have some beer to sell them. I'd happily gave them what I had and asked them for their goal. They said that they went to join the Order of Eventide. Some of their tribesmen already joined as Eventide Ghilmen and send them message, that the Order gave them considerably better armors and training, plus the opportunity to kill and loot any member of the Order of the Dawn they've met. You can imagine what that means for progenitor slavers like them. And they will be paid for doing it on top of that! I was tempted to join them myself!
str_bookseller_3_rumor_11|I have heard something for the Order of the Silvermist Rangers. Archers as any other Ravenstern archers you will say. But do you actually know why they are called Silvermist? Once a large warband from the White Deer clan fell upon the village of Uslum as the murderous claw of Vejovis himself. While they killing and looting, heavy silver fog surround them and with it, came the arrows of invisible archers. Dozens after dozens of clansmen died that day, charging against some misty silhouettes and found only silvered arrows in their chests. The other savages ran where their eyes could see. When the fog scattered, the surviving villagers found over two hundred corpses of their attackers, while their saviors were barely forty in number. They moved back into the mist without waiting for gratitude or reward, silent and eerie almost as the Noldor themselves. The name came from the Mystmountain savages, who barely escaped with their lives.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_12|You know the Senderfall's Guildmaster, yes? Squire Holbrook, the same one. His brother became Silvermist Hallberdier. It seems that the Order of the Silvermist Rangers isn't the typical one, as the other snobs around. They recruiting from the commoners too, offering decent training, payment and excellent armament. It seems that their Halberdiers not only receive a quality weapon, but also a full set of silvered plate armor, just as good as any knight's armor. Holbrook told me that his brother went to them only because of the armor. He knew that as a commoner there will be no chance for him to become a real Knight of the Dragon and the only thing he could hit with the bow were probably his own foot. Strange for a Ravenstern man indeed, but their father was actually from Windholm.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_13|I learned something about the Knights of the Dawn. Did you know that they took strong lads at the age of fifteen years and trained them for five years before to allow them to become full-fledged Knights of the Orders? The training is so rigorous, that usually no less than a fifth from the trainee fail, become cripples or just die. But by the time when they receive their white-gold armors they are truly fearsome warriors, completely mastered the art of the sword and the lance. Since they serve the Goddess of Justice, they vow not to cloud their minds with alcohol and such, to uphold the laws of the country and to persecute the Heretics. I was quite surprised to learn, that they build and maintain orphanages in Valonbray teaching the poor, the orphan and the abandoned children about Astraea's mercy and justice. They even allow the orphans to join their ranks at younger age, if they volunteers. It is not what I expected from people with their reputation.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_14|On my way to Valonbray I've met a group of Dawn Wyverns, binding some people on a stake. I asked what they did to deserve such fate and one of them told me that this particular band harassed the honest merchants on the road for four months, before to fell into their trap. Looking at four of their members, who still had arrows into their bodies I asked them why they didn't use bows too. The Wyvern looks at me with disdain and said: The bow is a weapon for the weaklings and the cowards. In our Order there are none such creatures. The axe is the weapon of the true warrior, who doesn't cower from any enemy. I am strong and fast enough to quickly reach any enemy on foot, despite the weight of my armor and shield. The Knights take care for the rest. Taking into consideration how twelve Dawn Wyverns were able to defeat twenty-eight bandits with only four lightly wounded, I was ready to believe him.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_15|A good friend of mine, Lucius Cenicius from Ethos, told me something about the Order of the Radiant Cross that still lurks in my mind. They call the Red Plague Snake Cult Plague, claiming that the Cult spreads it as a precursor to their invasion. But all of the new evidences about that claim are found  yes, from the very same Knights of the Radiant Cross. And nobody except them found any proof for that claim. In practice they may have spread the Red Plague themselves and to put the blame over the Cult only to justify their war against them! And to create a new plague a man must be great physician. Which their Order surely have at their disposal. How very convenient!
str_bookseller_3_rumor_16|During my last trip to Ethos I have met a few physicians from the Order of the Radiant Cross, without even one guard to protect them. It happens that they have been attacked from a Snake Cult warband and all of their Plaguewardens hold the Cultists, purchasing the physicians time to run with their own lives. I was shocked that somebody is willing to attack the honest physicians! But then I thought that they surely must hold a great grudge against them to risk with an attack so close to the town and its garrison!
str_bookseller_3_rumor_17|I will share with you the sad story of the young Sir Azrael, The Herald of Truth, a wandering Knight of the Griffons. He grew up into abbey`s smithy as an apprentice and left it after he killed a Knight of the Lion who asked his father`s regalia of Master of the Lore to be given to him and then kill his mother. He slew the noble cur, killer of unarmed widow and hanged his body from the abbey`s gate so everybody could see the Lion`s true dark essence. Since then he travels all over Pendor, proclaiming the truth about the indecent Lions, unworthy to be called knights and trying to receive justice for their wrongdoings against the Order of the Griffon and to himself. While most of the time his words fell into the deaf ears of people, too frightened to speak against trusted servants of a king, Sir Azrael swore that only the death will stop him from spreading the truth.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_18|I learned something about the presumably extinct Order of the Griffon. Many young nobles following the example of Sir Azrael, a wandering Knight of the Griffon, who swore sacred oath always to speak truth, to defend the weak, and to seek justice for the crimes against his order from the corrupted Knights of the Lion. The youngsters leaving their father`s estates with their warhorses and fine armors, looking for The Herald of Truth to be signed as his Retainers. While young they are good riders and skilled with both their silvered long swords and lances. Sir Azrael is famous as a formidable warrior and fully capable to turns the young Retainers into power to be reckoned with. I wont be surprised if they name him their new Grandmaster of the Order of the Griffon and then all villains, even the Lions, will tremble is fear.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_19|There is a new story about the noble Sir Azrael, a young knight who wears the insignia of the extinct Order of the Griffon. According to Tanim from Balanhi a band of robbers tried to loot his village. Sir Azrael, who accidentally moved through the village to purchase food organized the peasants and led them in fight, in which they managed to neutralize almost a third from the brigands and to capture the rest, at the cost of many dead villagers. But when the angry villagers were ready to torn the bandits on little pieces, Sir Azrael stand against them and with an effusive speech he taught them that bloody rampages of revenge accomplishes nothing and left the world worse off than it was before. The words of the charismatic young knight were so powerful, that the angry peasants decided not to take the law into their own hands and handed the villains to the king`s sheriff. Sir Azrael even refused the reward from the sheriff but insisted that the coins must be shared amongst the families of the deceased locals and then left on his way.
str_bookseller_3_rumor_20|Hard times becomes for the honest merchants, traveling through Sarleon, hard times indeed. Only three years ago you could see any Knight rushing in aid of anyone attacked on the road but the Knights from these days are not the same as before. My apprentice, Urbo from Marleon was attacked on his way to his home town from some Rogue Knights, his caravan was ransacked and his men were killed. Only he and five of his guards managed to run alive to the forest nearby, from where they saw a group from Knights of the Lion riding on the same road armed to the teeth over their fine warhorses and  moving near the Rogue Knights plundering his caravan as if they see nothing! Urbo and his men swore in Damia that they speak the truth, but the nobles cannot be accused from mere commoners in any of the king`s courts. What will happens with the Sarleon kingdom if its best warriors consider helping the commoners something under their dignity?
