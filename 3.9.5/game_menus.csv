menu_start_game_0|Welcome, adventurer, to Prophesy of Pendor! ^ Before beginning the game you must create your character. ^^ Be very careful, Adventurer. Your background choices here will forever impact your options and opportunities in Pendor.

mno_go_back|Go back
menu_start_phase_2|By the grace of the divine, you arrive in Pendor, a land plagued by constant strife for over 150 years. You have accepted a daunting challenge: to stave off the influence of evil, reunite the warring factions of the old Kingdom, and create a new possibility for Pendor, as echoed by the mad wanderer, Madigan. These are dangerous lands, where many powers, great and small, vie against one another for supremacy. Here you will find honor and nobility, but also deceit and skulduggery. There will be valorous knights, and black-hearted assassins. You will leave your past behind to start a new life. Pendor is not your typical medieval country. Women and men have equal chances of successes and failure in Pendor. If you succeed, you will create another destiny, a new possibility in the infinite dimensions of reality. Your choices may create a new thread in the weave for the Oracle to choose, and offer the possibility that your actions may save us all. Drawn by the stories you hear about Pendor and its kingdoms, you.

Different companions have different capabilities.^You may appoint new ministers from time to time. You may also change the location of your court, by speaking to the minister.
