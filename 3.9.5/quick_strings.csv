qstr_You_came_into_the_wo|You came into the world the {reg3?daughter:son} of displaced nobility from the land of Pendor. Your family fled the Pendoran city of Cez just after you were born, and purchased a tumbledown manor in an outlying district of Barclay. Your father and his retainers managed to provide you with a good education in the duties of the aristocracy and the idioms of life at court. Your mother and father rarely spoke of their history in Pendor, though you did get the sense that you mother was not from the Baccus Empire that now holds claim to the lands where your father was raised.
qstr_You_were_born_the_{r|You were born the {reg3?daughter:son} of a Fierdsvain Merchant Ship Captain, and his wife from Sarleon. Together they traded between Barclay and the Ports of Pendor, dodging pirates, outwitting corrupt harbor masters and avoiding the vicious Red Brotherhood, which seemed to grow stronger each year. Your father grew prosperous from his ventures, and paid off the debt on his ship to the Ship masters Guild in Barclay with a percentage of his earnings. It was a modest life but they provided you with a good education and a talent for making profit and opening new markets.
qstr_When_you_were_a_chil|When you were a child, your father earned a respectable living as a master-at-arms in Barclay, hiring out to those who could pay for his services. He had great skill with a sword. Patiently he taught you all he knew, and you became capable with both sword and lance. He was rough, callous, but fair. Your mother was a minor Noble from Pendor who spoke very little of her past - though she did let on that she met your father when he rescued her from kidnappers. Your father spoke only once of the Knighthood Order to which he belonged, and then only said that it had been outlawed by order of the former King of Sarleon. He refused to answer your many questions about his deeds or even the name of the Order, saying only that he preferred not to speak of it.
qstr_{reg3?daughter:son}|{reg3?daughter:son}
qstr_You_were_the_{reg3?d|You were the {reg3?daughter:son} of a man and woman who traveled with a band of mercenary adventurers. On many a night, you listened raptly to your their tales of bravery, adventure and sacrifice. They worked often for the Sheriff and Wardens in the outlying towns of Eastern Barclay, tracking down and capturing the poachers, outlaws and bandits who plagued the forests where you grew up. Both of them taught you how to survive in the wilds, to fight, and how to spot and avoid danger. 
qstr_Your_father_was_a_ba|Your father was a banished chieftain's son from the far lands of southern desert lands of Pendor. Growing up, you were a nomadic child, living in a wagon on the road. Your family traveled from place to place, camping for no more than half a year before moving on. Your father was born on the D'Shar Plains and your mother was a lady in waiting from Sarleon. They never really answered your many questions about how they knew each other or the circumstances around  their meeting. Your father told you many stories of how his people lived and fought, inspiring you with pride in your ancestry. Years ago, when their father died, his older brother had banished him from his tribe. He gathered up his wife and few possessions and moved to the Northern Plains of Barclay, where you were born. He was joined by other D'shar outcasts and these outcasts formed their own new tribe, living off the land and carrying on the traditions of their homeland across the Eastern Sea. He taught you how to fight, and how to survive through self-reliance.
qstr_Your_father_never_to|Your father never told you of your mother, and indeed seemed very secretive about his past, as you grew up in the poor section of Barclay's waterfront district. You received very little 'formal' education, however your father did teach you from a young age how to defend yourself, and how to spot and avoid danger. When you were a bit older, he taught you about herbs, poisons, and antidotes, and how to keep someone alive when they were wounded. He never stepped in to offer you protection from the local bullies, but insisted that you fight your own battles. He would often leave for extended periods of time, offering no explanation of where he was going, or saying when he would return. You raised yourself and sometimes had to resort to petty theft just to survive. Still, these difficult years made you streetwise, sharp to the secrets of cities and their shadowy back alley ways.
qstr_You_were_an_only_{re|You were an only {reg3?daughter:son} of noteworthy healers who, even though of noble blood, rejected the trappings of court intrigue and instead spent their lives traveling between the cities and towns of Barclay. Helping your parents make potions and healing the sick gave you an appreciation of life and a knowledge of healing. During your early travels with your parents, you became familiar with many cultures and heard many stories of distant lands. The spires of Veccavia, the scandalous bazaars of the Melitine, and the heroic poetry from the mountains of Mettenheim were tales that ignited the imagination. But of most fascination to you was the realm of Pendor. Always these stories kept you entranced, and early on you decided that someday you would travel to that land.
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you were sent to live in the court of one of the many minor outlying baronies of Barclay. There, your first lessons were in humility, as you waited upon the lords and ladies of the household. From their chess games, their gossip, and their poems of great deeds and courtly love, you quickly began to learn of the conflicts of adult life and competition. You learned even more from the rough games of other children, who fought with sticks in imitation of their elders' sword battles.
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you apprenticed with a local craftsman to learn his trade. After you spent years working hard and studying harder under your master, he promoted you to journeyman. Later, he employed you as a fully-paid crafter until you decided it was time to move on.
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_g|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you apprenticed to a wealthy merchant, learning your trade by managing inventories, selling merchandise, and traveling with his caravans. It was a hard life at first, but it grew easier as you learned how to pry out information, the art of buying low and selling high, and how to leave a customer thinking he'd beaten you, and driven the harder bargain himself.
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_b|As a {reg3?girl:boy} barely emerged from childhood, you lived on the streets, doing whatever you had to, just to survive. You begged, stole and worked for gangs to earn your bread, living only from day to day in a violent world, frequently only one step ahead of the law and others who wished you ill.
qstr_As_a_very_young_{reg|As a very young {reg3?girl:boy}, you rode the great steppes on a horse of your own, learning the paths through the grass and the desert. Though you sometimes went hungry, you became a skillful hunter and pathfinder despite - or perhaps because of - the relatively trackless country. Your body grew lean and muscular as you mastered the nomad's way of life.
qstr_{reg3?daughter:man}|{reg3?daughter:man}
qstr_Though_the_distincti|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. When you were named squire to a noble at court, you practiced with weapons for long hours, learning how to give hard knocks without hesitation and take them with fortitude. You were instructed in your obligations to your lord, and your duties to those who would one day be your vassals. In addition to learning the chivalric ideal, you also learned about the less attractive side of the noble life -- from old warriors' stories of ruthless power politics, betrayals and usurpations, of men who used guile, as well as valor, to achieve their aims.
qstr_{reg3?woman:man}|{reg3?woman:man}
qstr_Though_the_distinctio|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You joined the tightly-knit circle of women at court, ladies who lived for the appearance of propriety; the wives and mistresses of noblemen, as well as maidens who had yet to find a husband. Even here, however, you found politics at work, as the ladies schemed for prominence and fought each other bitterly just to catch the eye of whatever unmarried man was currently in fashion at court. You soon learned ways of turning these situations to your own advantage. With that knowledge came the realization that you could yourself wield great influence in the world, if you applied a little subtlety towards achieving your own goals.
qstr_Though_the_distinction|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You set out on your own, with nothing but your instrument and your voice. It was a poor existence, and you spent many a hungry night when people failed to appreciate your music, but you managed to get by on your music alone. As the years went by you became adept at playing to the drunken crowds in the taverns, and even better at talking anyone into whatever you wanted.
qstr_Though_the_distinction_|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You found yourself a student at the university of Barclay, in one of the great cities, where you studied the healing arts as well as theology and philosophy. Not all your lessons were learned in the lecture halls. Sometimes, you joined your fellows as they roamed the alleys in search of wine, {reg3?men:women}, or a good fight. You learned first-hand how to set a broken jaw, and how to persuade an angry townsman to set down his club and accept cash as compensation for the destruction of his shop.
qstr_Though_the_distinction_f|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. Heeding the call of the open road, you traveled from village to village, buying and selling. It was not a rich existence, but you became a master at negotiating a good price from even the most miserly elders. Soon, you knew, you would be well-placed to start your own trading empire...
qstr_Though_the_distinction_fe|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You pursued a career as an apprentice engineer and builder, crafting plans for homes, castles and towns. As time wore on you became a master of your trade, and your work started to bring you high prices. With food on your table and logs on your fire, you could take pride in your work and your growing reputation.
qstr_Though_the_distinction_fel|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. Dissatisfied with the common man's desperate scrabble for coin, you took to the forests and wilderness and decided to help yourself to its bounty. You hunted stags, boars and geese, and sold the precious meat on the sly. Later, your skills in tracking and pathfinding were often employed to track wanted outlaws for bounty. You made many friends, and many enemies as well. Your enterprise yielded more than a few silvers, of course.
qstr_Happiness_was_within|Happiness was within your reach as your wedding date approached. Your engagement to a lady-in-waiting was everything you hoped it would be. Her planning for the event consumed most of her time and she was excited for a future with you. One fateful day, a group of petulant nobles decided that she would be their next adventure. Upon hearing the commotion, you raced to her aid. Even though you killed two of the rogues, their leader fled like the coward he is, leaving your fiancée violated both physically and  mentally. The shame and horror of what happened to her was too much and she took her own life shortly thereafter, leaving you feeling angry and guilty for being unable to protect her in her time of need. Swearing revenge for this misdeed, you sought out the base scoundrel to exact your vengeance in his blood. Upon hearing of your intentions, he purchased his way out of facing you and fled to Pendor. You sell what you can and and take the next ship to Pendor, determined that he will not escape you...
qstr_Happiness_was_within_|Happiness was within your reach as your wedding date approached. Your engagement to a minor lord was everything you hoped it would be. Planning for the event consumed your time, until the fateful day when a group of petulant nobles decided that you would be their next adventure. Your fiancée, hearing the commotion, raced to your aid but was overpowered and killed in the ensuing melee. Grabbing his up his sword, you killed two of the rogues in your anger and despair, but their leader fled like the coward he is. You later learned that he purchased passage to Pendor with the Red Brotherhood to escape the calls for justice in your fiancée's name. Determined not to let this misdeed go unpunished, you pack your belongings and travel to Pendor to exact your revenge...
qstr_For_the_last_several|For the last several years you lived the life of a wandering bard, charming your way into the hearts of nobles who would be your patron and support your quest for artistic perfection. That was until you met the love of your life, who was not only enamored with your artistry, but also genuinely in love with you. One fateful night, when you were away tending to a minor task, a group of hooded men kidnapped your beloved for ransom. Unfortunately even though the wealthy parents of your beloved paid the ransom, your love was found dead the next morning. Swearing vengeance, you hunted down the scoundrels responsible for this heinous crime and cut most of them down with your crossbow and sword. Unfortunately, you were unable to slay the leader of the band, who escaped. Later, you discovered that he fled to Pendor with the help of the local Red Brotherhood. Swearing that this jackal will not escape justice, you book passage for Pendor...
qstr_For_the_last_several_|For the last several years you had studied under a renowned and kindly scholar at the Barclay university, who treated you as if you were his child. Working beside him, you learned a great deal about medicine and the higher arts. Then one day, several cloaked men broke into the university and confronted your mentor - and after a heated argument they stabbed him and set fire to his room. As you raced to your mentors aid, the men escaped into the night. Unfortunately, you were unable to save him from the flames due to his injuries. Salvaging what you could of his research, you set forth to investigate the matter. You soon found that the cloaked men were from Pendor, and that they had returned shortly after their visit to the university. Swearing that you would exact revenge for this misdeed, you book passage for Pendor...
qstr_As_a_merchant_you_kn|As a merchant you know that there will always be enemies, but even then, some things cross the line. Years of work and negotiations had you on the verge of creating a network of trading caravans that would provide for you and your future family. There was a very profitable opportunity with a particular caravan that would cement your legacy. As the fates would weave, your dreams were thwarted by cold steel and the villainy of a rival merchant - who had hired highwaymen to waylay your caravan and not steal, but destroy, the merchandise and kill everyone guarding it, including you. The highwaymen were successful in destroying your cargo, and as they were in the act of slaying your guards and drivers one by one, they let out the name of who hired them. One thing did not go to their plan however, and that was the unexpected arrival of a Barclay lancer patrol who managed to save you from an early demise. The rival merchant, learning that his plans were only partially successful and with a bounty on his head, fled to Pendor to escape being arrested. You swear that he would not get away from his crimes, and so you sell your remaining possessions and book passage for Pendor...
qstr_Happiness_was_within_y|Happiness was within your reach as your wedding date approached. Alongside wedding preparation, you were working as second engineer in a castle reconstruction project. A fire set by the primary engineer to hide shoddy work claimed not only your reputation, but your life of your betrothed.

qstr_You_and_a_group_of_f|You and a group of fellow friends and hunters were ambushed by highwaymen looking to rob you.

To this end, you book passage on the next ship to Pendor...
qstr_His_death_was_swift_|His death was swift and violent, at the hands of an unknown assailant. The message you received afterwards from your mother was vague and confusing. In it, she warned you that your father's enemies were seeking both her demise and your own. She advised you to flee from Barclay and travel to Pendor - only there would you be beyond the reach of these knaves. She stated that she had to go into hiding, and that she would be safe and not to worry about her.

The missive warned you of an unseen enemy that had been seeking both your father's demise and your own. Apparently, your father was not your real father, but rather had been keeping you in hiding since you were an infant. He was a hired blade sent to kill your real mother and father, and he succeeded, but he could not bring himself to kill you as an infant. He decided to spare you, and keep you hidden from those who had paid to see you dead. He always felt guilt at his deeds, and tried as best he was able to raise you so that you could survive on your own. Recently, his past employers discovered his subterfuge and your continued existence. He had left instructions with a trusted friend that should anything happen to him, you should be sent this letter, along with his knives, his regrets of past actions, and this warning: Leave Barclay immediately as your life is in danger. Travel to Pendor, there you will find a safe haven. Deciding to heed his words, you book passage to Pendor...

The missive tells you that you were not their child, but was in fact given to them to raise. Your real parents feared for your safety, and so they put you in the care of your adoptive parents - just weeks before assassins finally caught up to them and killed them. Since that time, your adoptive parents feared that some day, those who would see your family dead would catch up to them and slay them all, including you. That day has apparently arrived, with your adoptive father dead and your adoptive mother only alive through sheer luck, and the assassins now turning their sight to you. She reassured you that she is in hiding and safe, but stressed that your life is in danger, and urged you to leave Barclay immediately. She gifted you your father's book of healing, and asked your forgiveness for not telling you earlier that you were adopted. So, to escape these hidden enemies, you booked a passage to Pendor...

It is with a heavy heart that I must tell you that your path in life was dictated to you the moment you were born. You see, my {s14}, your mother was of ancient noble lineage, and in your veins flows the blood of the old Kings of Pendor. I was hired to find and kill her for precisely that reason. When I found her after years of searching, she was near death and you were swaddled in her arms. I did not have it in me to end her life, much less yours. My healing arts were not sufficient to save her, so I made it look as if I had killed her, collected the reward and then disappeared to raise you. I do not ask your forgiveness, only your understanding that sometimes a man is forced down a path not of his choosing. I know first-hand that there are those who are seeking you to end your life, as I have now come across those who seek to kill me for my failure to take your life as an infant. I have dealt with one initial group looking for us here in Barclay, and have wounds to heal for my trouble. I know there are many more out there, and that they will not stop until both of us are dead. I have gone into hiding; my part in your life is done, so do not try to find me. Take heed!

It is with a heavy heart that I must tell you that your path in life was dictated to you the moment you were born. You see, my {s14}, your mother and I are not your real parents. You came to us when you were a newborn, from a noblewoman fleeing for her life from Pendor. She was fearful that her time was limited, and did not want you to share her fate. She told us she was of ancient noble lineage, the great-grandchild of the only true surviving member of the royal Pendorian line of Kings. After she gave you to us we found her along the road the next day near death, having been stabbed multiple times. Our healing arts were not sufficient to save her, so we buried her at the local church and took you in as if you were our child. We are sorry we did not tell you this before, and ask your understanding that what we have done was for your own protection. We tell you this now as we fear that those who took your mother's life have returned. We have been followed, and have heard of hooded men asking questions about our travels and our routes. More concerning are the questions they ask about you and your age. We fear that they mean you harm or worse. We have gone into hiding and feel that we will be safe. However, you should not stay in Barclay. Flee! Flee to the lands of Pendor and seek answers. In any case, be well and be safe in your travels.
